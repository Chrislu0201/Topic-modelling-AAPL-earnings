include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on a when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand alone selling prices ssp because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided the company s process for determining estimated ssps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company s

to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment of whether an available for sale debt security is

and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth the company has international operations with sales outside the u s representing a majority of the company s total net sales in addition a majority of the company s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the u s as a result the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company s products and insolvency a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully the company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company s competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions some of the markets in which the company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the company s existing products the company s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on single sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company s business and result in harm to the company s reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company s products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the company s products and services and result in harm to the company s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost sales the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company s products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services the company s minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers the company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store mac app store and tv app store the company retains a commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in app purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s cost of sales and operating expenses except as described in part i item 1 of this form 10 q in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in note 10 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs the company s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company s financial condition and operating results including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company s business tariffs could increase the cost of the company s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs could also make the company s products more expensive for customers which could make the company s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company s ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company s business many of the company s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company the company s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers the company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the company s sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost structures the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar relative to local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u s dollar s strengthening which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency denominated sales conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of december 29 2018 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u s internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected ","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business except as described in part i item 1 of this form 10 q in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in note 10 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected refer to the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk

the tax cuts and jobs act the act which significantly changed u s tax law the act lowered the company s u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income by operation of law the company applied a blended u s statutory federal income tax rate of 24 5 for 2018 the 2018 blended u s tax rate the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the company s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended u s tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the act the company s effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended u s tax rate partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the act the lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of

september 29 2018 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 6 3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 426 million management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the

creditable against u s taxes subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the act as of september 29 2018 the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow where it will remain

certain other products the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device s essential software and or non software services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services based on the company s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company s operating results valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results inventory valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees the company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities in addition the company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory the company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends if the company determines inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value it records a write down of the inventories the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value any write downs and or impairments the company may be required to record would adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products a change in the company s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products the company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results warranty costs the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the company s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the company s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results on december 22 2017 the u s enacted the act which significantly changed u s tax law the act lowered the company s u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the impact of the act increased the company s provision for income taxes by 1 5 billion during 2018 this increase was composed of 2 0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and 1 2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax partially offset by a 1 7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the company s unrecognized tax benefits certain amounts reported by the company related to the act are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 resolution of the act s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10 k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item 12 security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters the information required by this item is set forth under the headings other information security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and other information equity compensation plan information in the company s 2019 proxy statement to be filed with the sec within 120 days after september 29 2018 and is incorporated herein by reference ","item 1a risk factors the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10 k the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth the company has international operations with sales outside the u s representing a majority of the company s total net sales in addition a majority of the company s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the u s as a result the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company s products and insolvency a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company s competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions some of the markets in which the company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the company s existing products the company s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on single sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company s business and result in harm to the company s reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company s products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the company s products and services and result in harm to the company s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company s products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services the company s minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers the company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store mac app store and tv app store the company retains a commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in app purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs the company s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company s financial condition and operating results including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company s business tariffs could increase the cost of the company s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs could also make the company s products more expensive for customers which could make the company s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company s ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company s business many of the company s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company the company s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the company s sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost structures the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar relative to local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u s dollar s strengthening which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency denominated sales conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 29 2018 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u s internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected ","item 3 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected refer to the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results ","item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 29 2018 and september 30 2017 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 4 9 billion and 6 0 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september 29 2018 and september 30 2017 the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 102 5 billion and 103 7 billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt as of september 29 2018 and september 30 2017 to increase by 399 million and 376 million on an annualized basis respectively further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 5 debt foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of 592 million as of september 29 2018 compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of 485 million as of september 30 2017 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 29 2018 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company s actual exposures and positions ","item 9a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the exchange act were effective as of september 29 2018 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the

by reason of their status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the

arise critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed

the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in part i item 1 of this form 10 q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of the 2017 form 10 k and critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii item 7 of the 2017 form 10 k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s condensed consolidated financial statements with the exception of income taxes there have been no material changes to the company s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10 k income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the company s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with

billion to 900 million the impact of the adjustments to the provisional estimate for the deemed repatriation tax and unrecognized tax benefits was included in the company s income tax expense during the third quarter of 2018 resolution of the provisional estimates of the act s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results ","item 1a risk factors the following description of risk factors includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of risk factors associated with the

those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth the company has international operations with sales outside the u s representing a majority of the company s total net sales in addition a majority of the company s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the u s as a result the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company s products and insolvency a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company s business and result in harm to the company s reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company s products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the company s products and services and result in harm to the company s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses except as described in part i item 1 of this form 10 q in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company s business tariffs could increase the cost of the company s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on sales of its products tariffs could also make the company s products more expensive for customers which could make the company s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company s ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company s business many of the company s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue because the company relies on sole or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company the company s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of june 30 2018 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected ","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business except as described in part i item 1 of this form 10 q in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors the

and was recognized during the first quarter of 2018 this 2 6 billion provisional estimate included 1 8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring to reduce the company s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate and approximately 800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax resolution of the provisional estimates of the act s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results ","item 1a risk factors the following description of risk factors includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of risk factors associated with the company s business previously disclosed in part i item 1a of the 2017 form 10 k and in part ii item 1a of the form 10 q for the quarter ended december 30 2017 in each case under the heading risk factors the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses except as described in part i item 1 of this form 10 q in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in note 9 commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge

second quarter of 2018 to be between 38 0 and 38 5 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2018 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition the company s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating

to the company s core business strategy selling general and administrative the growth in selling general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in

december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 was as follows dollars in millions the decrease in other income expense net during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was due

weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2 11 and 1 87 in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively provision for income taxes provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the three months ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 were as follows dollars in millions on december 22 2017 the u s enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the act which significantly changed u s tax law the act lowered the company s u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income by operation of law the company will apply a blended u s statutory federal income tax rate of 24 5 for 2018 the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the company s effective tax rate of 25 8 for the first quarter of 2018 differs from the blended rate of 24 5 due primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by the impact of taxes on foreign earnings the company s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is slightly lower than the first quarter of 2017 due to the

approximately 15 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected effective tax rate during 2018 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future expected tax rate can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors the company s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 differed from the u s statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the company is subject to audits by federal state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs on august 30 2016 the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the state aid decision the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014 irish legislative changes effective as of january 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union ireland has also appealed the state aid decision although ireland is still computing the recovery amount the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission s announced recovery amount of 13 billion plus interest of 1 billion once the recovery amount is finalized by ireland the company anticipates funding it by placing amounts into escrow in 2018 pending conclusion of all appeals the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u s taxes recent accounting pronouncements hedging in august 2017 the financial accounting standards board

opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to indemnification of third parties the company offers an iphone upgrade program which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iphone in the u s the u k and mainland china the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iphone provided certain conditions are met the company accounts for the trade in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in part i item 1 of this form 10 q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of the 2017 form 10 k and critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii item 7 of the 2017 form 10 k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s condensed consolidated financial statements with the exception of income taxes there have been no material changes to the company s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10 k income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the company s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results on december 22 2017 the u s enacted the act which significantly changed u s tax law the act lowered the company s u s statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings during the first quarter of 2018 the company recognized a provision for income taxes of 7 0 billion of which 2 6 billion was considered a provisional estimate under the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 the company s provisional estimate of 2 6 billion included 1 8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring the company s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate and approximately 800 million net associated with the deemed repatriation tax resolution of the provisional estimates of the act s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results ","item 1a risk factors the following description of risk factors includes any material changes to and supersedes the description of risk factors associated with the company s business previously disclosed in part i item 1a of the 2017 form 10 k under the heading risk factors the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of december 30 2017 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be

gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating expenses research and development the year over year growth in r d expense in 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily by increases in headcount related expenses and material costs to support expanded r d activities the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company s core business strategy selling general and administrative the year over year growth in selling general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount related expenses variable selling expenses and infrastructure related costs the decrease in selling general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs partially offset by an increase in headcount related expenses other income expense net the year over year increase

exchange related items the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1 99 1 73 and 1 49 in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for 2017 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher u s r d tax credits the lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater r d tax credits as of september 30 2017 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 3 9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 31 5 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance the irs concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017 all years prior to 2013

jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs on august 30 2016 the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the state aid decision the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014 irish legislative changes effective as of january 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union ireland has also appealed the state aid decision although ireland is still computing the recovery amount the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission s announced recovery amount of 13 billion plus interest of 1 billion once the recovery amount is finalized by ireland the company anticipates funding it including interest out of foreign cash these amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018 where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals the company believes that any incremental irish

contractual obligation table indemnification agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to indemnification of third parties the company offers an iphone upgrade program which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iphone in the u s the u k and mainland china the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iphone provided certain conditions are met the company accounts for the trade in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred for most of the company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit for payment terms in excess of the company s standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software and or undelivered non software services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device s essential software and or non software services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services based on the company s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company s operating results valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results inventory valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a write down for inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory and or impairments of manufacturing related assets or inventory prepayments these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company s suppliers that hold any of the company s manufacturing related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such write downs would adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write downs were recorded the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products a change in the company s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded warranty costs the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the company s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10 k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item 12 security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters the information required by this item is set forth under the headings other information security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and other information equity compensation plan information in the company s 2018 proxy statement to be filed with the sec within 120 days after september 30 2017 and is incorporated herein by reference ","item 1a risk factors the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10 k the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 30 2017 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u s internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected ","item 3 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results ","item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 30 2017 and september 24 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 6 0 billion and 4 9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september 30 2017 and september 24 2016 the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 103 7 billion and 78 9 billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt as of september 30 2017 and september 24 2016 to increase by 376 million and 271 million on an annualized basis respectively further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 debt foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign denominated debt issuances the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of 485 million as of september 30 2017 compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of 434 million as of september 24 2016 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 30 2017 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company s actual exposures and positions ","item 9a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the exchange act were effective as of september 30 2017 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to the company s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements management including the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting the company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a 15f under the exchange act management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on the company s assessment management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 30 2017 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap the company s independent registered public accounting firm ernst young llp has issued an audit report on the company s internal control over financial reporting which appears in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in the company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2017 which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph d of rules 13a 15 and 15d 15 under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company s internal control over financial reporting ","item 9b other information not applicable "

from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or canceled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of july 1 2017 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected ","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results ","item 3 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there have been no material changes to the company s market risk during the first nine months of 2017 for a discussion of the company s exposure to market risk refer to the company s market risk disclosures set forth in part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the 2016 form 10 k ","item 4 controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the exchange act were effective as of july 1 2017 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time

downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating expenses

follows dollars in millions the company s effective tax rates during the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed

could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of april 1 2017 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual

risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as

ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the higher year over year effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2017

authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty

risk factors the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made

unfavorable leverage on fixed costs from lower net sales partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to services the year over year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and to a lesser extent by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales these positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and to a lesser extent by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2017 to be between 38 and 38 5 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2017 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating expenses research and development the year over year growth in r d expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and material costs to support expanded r d activities the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the company s core business strategy selling general and administrative the decrease in selling general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses the year over year growth in selling general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising other income expense net the year over year increase in other income expense net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1 73 1 49 and 1 11 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for 2016 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater r d tax credits the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes as of september 24 2016 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 4 1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 26 0 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company reached a partial settlement with the irs on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012 in connection with this settlement the company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements all years prior to 2013 are closed except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to r d tax credits in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities in major states and major foreign jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs on august 30 2016 the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the state aid decision the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through september 2014 irish legislative changes effective as of the beginning of 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the general court of the court of justice of the european union ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the state aid decision while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to 13 billion plus interest the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission s guidance once the

liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred for most of the company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit for payment terms in excess of the company s standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software and or undelivered non software services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device s essential software and or non software services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services based on the company s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company s operating results valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the company s operating results inventory valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a write down for inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory and or impairments of manufacturing related assets or inventory prepayments these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company s suppliers that hold any of the company s manufacturing related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such write downs would adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write downs were recorded the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products a change in the company s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded warranty costs the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10 k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item 12 security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters the information required by this item is set forth under the headings security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and equity compensation plan information in the company s 2017 proxy statement to be filed with the sec within 120 days after september 24 2016 and is incorporated herein by reference ","item 1a risk factors the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10 k the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 24 2016 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u s internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected ","item 3 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2016 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results ","item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 24 2016 and september 26 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 4 9 billion and 4 3 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september 24 2016 and september 26 2015 the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 78 9 billion and 55 8 billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt as of september 24 2016 and september 26 2015 to increase by 271 million and 200 million on an annualized basis respectively further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 debt foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and may enter in the future into non designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign denominated debt issuances the company s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of 434 million as of september 24 2016 compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of 342 million as of september 26 2015 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24 2016 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions ","item 9a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the exchange act were effective as of september 24 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the

that the company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting the company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a 15f under the exchange act management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of

year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance net sales decreased 15 or 7 2 billion during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015 primarily driven by lower unit sales and a reduction in the average selling price asp for

lower year over year during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 due primarily to a shift in the mix of iphones ipad the following table presents ipad net sales and unit sales information for the three and nine month periods ended june 25 2016 and june 27 2015 dollars in millions and units in thousands ipad net sales increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in

to lower unit sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar partially offset by higher asps for ipad the company believes the year over year decline in unit sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for ipads and some level of cannibalization from the company s other products mac the following

gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph

compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly

the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the lower effective tax rate during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2016 the company

taxes in the period such resolution occurs on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission s assertions are without

indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim

results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors

statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected table of contents the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products table of contents the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues table of contents the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer table of contents the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products table of contents compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting table of contents there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located table of contents the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins table of contents the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of june 25 2016 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland for example in june 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to conclude against ireland it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid and such amount could be material the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected table of contents","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company

technologies table of contents business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance net sales decreased 13 or 7 5 billion during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in 2015 primarily driven by lower iphone sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar the company had strong year over year net sales growth in services and other products during the second quarter of 2016 the company introduced iphone se and the 9 7 inch ipad prou0099 both of which were available beginning in the third quarter of 2016 the company utilized 7 0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend

2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 the company believes the unit sales decline is due primarily to the acceleration of iphone upgrades in the first half of 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world average selling prices asps for iphone were lower year over year during the second quarter and first six months of 2016 due to a change in the mix of iphones and the effect

march 28 2015 dollars in millions and units in thousands ipad net sales and unit sales declined during the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 the company believes the decline in ipad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for ipads and some level of cannibalization from the company s other products year over year asps for ipad were flat

shift in mix to products and services with higher margins the company anticipates gross margin during the third quarter of 2016 to be between 37 5 and 38 0 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2016 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange

increase in r d expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses including

follows dollars in millions the company s effective tax rates during the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed

outside the u s the lower effective tax rate during the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings the

authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty

period such resolution occurs on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission s assertions are without merit if the european commission were to conclude against ireland the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid while such amount could be material as of march 26 2016 the company is unable to estimate the impact recent accounting pronouncements stock compensation in march 2016 the

indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim

exposure to such obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles

the 2015 form 10 k and in part ii item 1a of the form 10 q for the quarter ended december 26 2015 in each case under the heading risk factors the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 q the following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i item 1 financial statements and part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them table of contents global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions table of contents the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company table of contents the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products table of contents with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results table of contents the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost table of contents investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability table of contents the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention table of contents the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of march 26 2016 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland for example in june 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to conclude against ireland it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid and such amount could be material the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected table of contents","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part ii item 1a of this

against the company and five major book publishers in the u s district court for the southern district of new york alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of 1 of the sherman act and seeking among other things injunctive relief the district court s declaration that the company s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and or the district court s reformation of such agreements on july 10 2013 the district court found following a bench trial that the company conspired to restrain trade in violation of 1 of the sherman act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with 1 of the sherman act the district court entered a permanent injunction which took effect on october 6 2013 and will be in effect for five years the company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the terms of the district court s order including renegotiating agreements with the five major ebook publishers updating its antitrust

particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or

margin gross margin for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 was as follows dollars in millions the year over year increase in the gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2016 was driven

margin during the second quarter of 2016 to be between 39 and 39 5 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2016 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating expenses operating expenses for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 were as follows

position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and updated products that are central to the company s core business strategy selling general and administrative the

organized in ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the lower effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings as well as the retroactive reinstatement of the u s federal r d tax credit the u s internal revenue service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012 and all years prior to 2010 are closed in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management

in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission s assertions are without merit if the european commission were to conclude against ireland the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid while such amount could be material as of december 26 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact recent accounting pronouncements in january 2016 the financial accounting standards board

whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating

part i item 2 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10 q because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them table of contents global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions table of contents the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company table of contents the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers table of contents the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses table of contents regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses table of contents the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders table of contents the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability the company s privacy policy which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data is posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations table of contents the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss table of contents the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of december 26 2015 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland for example in june 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to conclude against ireland it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid and such amount could be material the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected table of contents","item 1 legal proceedings the company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part ii item 1a of this form 10 q under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the first quarter of

permanent injunction which took effect on october 6 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal the company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the terms of the district court s order including renegotiating agreements with the five major ebook publishers updating its antitrust training program and completing a two year monitorship with a court appointed antitrust compliance monitor whose appointment the district court ended in october 2015 the company appealed the district court s decision pursuant to a settlement agreement reached in june

categories except mac and reductions in unit sales of ipad net sales in 2014 were also negatively affected by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar including the australian dollar table of contents gross margin the year over year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and

effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar the year over year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2014 was driven by multiple factors including lower commodity costs a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales which was partially offset by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar price reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2016 to be between 39 and 40 the foregoing statement regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2016 is forward looking and could differ from actual results the company s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors and those described in this paragraph in general the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the u s dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates operating expenses research and development the year over year growth in r d expense in 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses including share based compensation costs and material costs to support expanded r d activities the company continues to believe that focused investments in r d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and updated products that are central to the company s core business strategy selling

compensation costs and higher spending on marketing and advertising table of contents other income expense net the increase in other income expense net during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher interest income partially offset by higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity and higher interest expense on debt the decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1 49 1 11 and 1 03 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for 2015 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no u s taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u s the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes the effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was relatively flat as of september 26 2015 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 7 8 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 24 1 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance the u s internal revenue service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012 and all years prior to 2010 are closed in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities in major states and major foreign jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission s assertions are without merit if the european commission were to conclude against ireland the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid while such amount could be material as of september 26 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014 the

the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors revenue recognition net sales consist

loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred for most of the company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit for payment terms in excess of the company s standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with

until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company s operating results valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new

indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory and or manufacturing related assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company s suppliers that hold any of the company s manufacturing related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such write downs would adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results in the period when the write downs were recorded table of contents the company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products a change in the company s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded warranty costs the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10 k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected table of contents item 12 security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters the information required by this item is set forth under the headings security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and equity compensation plan information in the company s 2016 proxy statement to be filed with the sec within 120 days after september 26 2015 and is incorporated herein by reference ","item 1a risk factors the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10 k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10 k the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected table of contents the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that include content provided to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers table of contents many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company table of contents the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers table of contents the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses table of contents regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses table of contents the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders table of contents the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability the company s privacy policy which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data is posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s r d activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations table of contents the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss table of contents the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 26 2015 a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland for example in june 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation of ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to conclude against ireland it could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid and such amount could be material the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u s or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected table of contents","item 3 legal proceedings the company is subject to the legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factor the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in part i item 1a of this form 10 k under the heading risk factors the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2015 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s financial condition or operating results apple ebooks antitrust litigation united states of america v apple inc et al on april 11 2012 the u s department of justice filed a civil antitrust action against the company and five major book publishers in the u s district court for the southern district of new york alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of 1 of the sherman act and seeking among other things injunctive relief the district court s declaration that the company s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and or the district court s reformation of such agreements on july 10 2013 the district court found following a bench trial that the company conspired to restrain trade in violation of 1 of the sherman act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with 1 of the sherman act the district court entered a permanent injunction which took effect on october 6 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is overturned on appeal the company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the terms of the district court s order including renegotiating agreements with the five major ebook publishers updating its antitrust training program and completing a two year monitorship with a court appointed antitrust compliance monitor whose appointment the district court ended in october 2015 the company appealed the district court s decision pursuant to a settlement agreement reached in june 2014 any damages the company may be obligated to pay will be determined by the outcome of the final adjudication following exhaustion of all appeals ","item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 4 3 billion and 3 4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 56 0 billion and 29 0 billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 to increase by 200 million and 110 million on an annualized basis respectively further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10 k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 debt foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and may enter in the future into non designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign denominated debt issuances the company s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures table of contents to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of 342 million as of september 26 2015 compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of 240 million as of september 27 2014 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions table of contents","item 9a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company s management the company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a 15e and 15d 15e under the securities

that the company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative

been detected also any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business

the bank holding company act of 1956 and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment our results for the first quarter reflect a solid start to the year with broad based billings and revenue growth across our businesses and geographies we continued to invest in new services and card member benefits new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network and we returned a significant amount of capital to

we continue to exit the network business in europe and australia due to certain regulatory changes excluding the billings from those geographies gns billed business grew 6 percent year over year revenues net of interest expense increased 7 percent 9 percent on an fx adjusted basis driven by a well balanced mix of growth across card member spending loan volumes and fee income 1 card fee revenue reflected an increase in card member acquisitions and higher fees on certain of our card products around the world as we continued to add benefits to our product offerings card member loans grew year over year as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members provisions for losses increased at a lower rate than in recent quarters due to a smaller reserve build compared to the prior year the higher reserve build in the first quarter of last year was due to an acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book the increased stability in the lending portfolio in the current year resulted in a lower reserve build compared to q1 18 we expect provisions for losses to grow at a higher rate than the first quarter over the balance of the year spending on customer engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and business development expenses increased year over year across all categories increases in rewards and card member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of investment across many of our premium travel related benefits marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives including card member acquisition continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives we expect spending on customer engagement to continue to increase including as a result of our recently announced renewal of our relationships with delta air lines our largest cobrand partner we continue to see attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and plan to invest to take advantage of them in order to drive revenue growth over the moderate to long term while we

card member loans which provides a measure of profitability of our card member loan portfolio net interest yield on average card member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average card member loans computed on an annualized basis net interest income divided by average card member loans computed on an annualized basis a gaap measure includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the card member loan portfolio and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average card member loans table of contents business segment

stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are

is approved by our board of directors in lieu of the quantitative stress test the federal reserve provided us with a formula that defines our maximum payout capacity during the period july 1 2019 through june 30 2020 funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility while we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that the personal savings high yield savings account program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time summary of consolidated debt table 17 summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits we may redeem from time to time certain debt

securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of march 31 2019 we maintained a committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust

of the federal reserve we had approximately 72 5 billion as of march 31 2019 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria table of contents committed bank credit facility in

operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the increase in net cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio and growth in card member receivables and loans compared to a decline in the prior year cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits long term debt and short term borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a smaller decrease in debt and larger customer deposits partially offset by a higher level of share repurchases table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from or served subpoenas on us seeking information relating to a small specialized part of our business known as foreign exchange international payments fxip which offers cross border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries including the united states in particular we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the u s department of justice as well as inquiries from the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the federal deposit insurance corporation and others fxip accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses relatedly we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of fxip s pricing practices we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2018 the 2018 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network for more information on payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2018 form 10 k table of contents surcharging in various countries such as certain member states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts our business in addition other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread for more information on the potential impacts of

enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with

various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws on june 25 2018 the supreme court found in favor of american express in that case we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the cases it is possible that actions impairing the card member

the u s corporate income tax rate resulting from the tax act along with several discrete tax benefits our worldwide billed business increased 9 percent over the prior year reflecting strong proprietary billings growth both in the u s and internationally and across customer segments proprietary billings growth was driven by increased spending within our premium consumer base as well as

including the acquisition of the portion of the hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own the acquired hilton portfolio provisions for losses increased reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and a higher lending write off rate write off rates continue to modestly increase due to ongoing seasoning of our loan portfolio spending on customer engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and business development expenses increased year over year across all categories increases in rewards and card member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of investment across many of our premium travel services marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives including new card acquisition our global brand campaign continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives while impacted by several discrete items operating expenses were flat year over year and remained well controlled which allowed for additional investment in customer engagement we plan to continue making investments in our business to generate and sustain a strong level

consolidated results of operations effective january 1 2018 we adopted new revenue recognition guidance using the full retrospective method which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented starting january 1 2016 the adoption changed the recognition timing and classification of certain revenues and expenses including changes to the presentation of certain credit and

refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition we reclassified certain business development expenses from other expenses to marketing and business development expenses which was not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance during 2018 we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead

on billed business performance the average discount rate was 2 37 percent 2 40 percent and 2 43 percent for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively several factors continued to drive the average discount rate decline including impacts from decisions we made with respect to certain strategic partners the impact of regulatory changes in europe and australia and the continued roll out of the optblue program though the impacts began to moderate in the latter half of the year net card fees increased in both periods primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain key international countries other fees and commissions increased in both periods primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue and increases in delinquency fees other revenues decreased in both periods the decrease in 2018 was partly driven by a modification of one of our gns arrangements lower breakage related to our prepaid cards and a decline in revenues related to the gbt jv the decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by prior year revenues related to the loyalty edge business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a contractual payment from a gns partner also in the prior year interest income increased in both periods primarily reflecting higher average card member loans and higher yields the growth in average card member loans in 2018 was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers as well as the inclusion of the acquired hilton portfolio the growth in average card member loans in 2017 was primarily driven by a mix shift towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances the increase in yields in both periods was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets specific pricing actions and increases in benchmark interest rates interest expense increased in both periods primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average long term debt and additionally in 2018 by higher average deposits table 3 provisions for losses summary provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased in both periods primarily driven by growth in receivables due to increased billed business and higher net write offs largely in the corporate and small business portfolios card member loans provision for losses increased in both periods driven by strong loan growth higher net write offs and a modest increase in delinquencies the increases in write offs and delinquencies were due in part to the seasoning of recent loan vintages other provision for losses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in 2018 was primarily due to growth in the non card lending and commercial financing portfolios 2017 compared to 2016 also reflected growth in the non card lending portfolio which was offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio table of

increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 the variances for both periods were primarily driven by lower levels of spending on growth initiatives in 2017 compared to the preceding and subsequent years the higher spending on growth initiatives in 2018 included our new global brand campaign continued investments in partnerships and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes card member rewards expense increased in both periods the increase in 2018 was driven by increases in membership rewards and cash back reward expenses of 558 million and cobrand rewards expense of 451 million both of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by higher spending volumes and enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards during 2017 the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants increased to 96 percent rounded up at december 31 2018 compared to 95 percent rounded down at december 31 2017 and 2016 card member services expense increased in both periods primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits and enhanced platinum card benefits salaries and employee benefits expense was flat for both periods reflecting increases in incentive compensation offset by lower restructuring charges compared to the respective prior year other expense increased in both periods the increase in 2018 was primarily driven by higher technology expenses a loss in the current year on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business and a foreign exchange loss related to the devaluation of the argentine peso which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of july 1 2018 all partially offset by current year unrealized gains on certain equity investments and charges in the prior year related to our u s loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by gains in 2016 on the sales of the hfs portfolios which were recognized as an expense reduction partially offset by lower technology related costs in 2017 and higher loyalty edge related costs in 2016 income taxes the effective tax rate for 2018 was 14 8 percent and reflects a benefit of 496 million relating to changes in the tax method of accounting for certain expenses the resolution of certain prior years tax audits and an adjustment to the 2017 provisional tax charge related to the tax act the tax rate for 2018 also reflects the reduction in the u s federal statutory

prepaid and gift card businesses corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations including the gbt jv are included in corporate other results of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand alone business the management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below total revenues net of interest expense we allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology within the gcsg and gcs segments discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment s card members within the gmns segment discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue net card fees and other fees and commissions are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported interest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates provisions for losses the provisions for losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported expenses marketing and business development expense is included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred global brand advertising is primarily reflected in corporate other and may be allocated to the segments based on the actual expense incurred rewards and card member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred within the segment salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses reflect expenses such as professional services occupancy and equipment and communications incurred directly within each segment in addition expenses related to support services such as technology costs are allocated to each segment primarily based on support service activities directly attributable to the segment certain other overhead expenses are allocated from corporate other to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue and card member loans and receivables income taxes an income tax provision benefit is allocated to each reportable operating segment based on the effective tax rates applicable to the various businesses that comprise the segment the 2017 2 6 billion charge related to the tax act was allocated in full to corporate other table of contents global consumer services group table 9 gcsg selected income statement data gcsg primarily issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards globally gcsg also provides services to consumers including travel services and non card financing products and manages certain international joint ventures and our partnership agreements in china total revenues net of interest expense non interest revenues increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by discount revenue which increased 10 percent reflecting an increase in proprietary consumer billed business of 12 percent partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate u s proprietary consumer billed business increased 10 percent and non u s proprietary consumer billed business increased 17 percent the increases in billed business reflected higher cards in force and higher average spend per card the increase in non interest revenues was also driven by 13 percent growth in net card fees and increased other fees and commissions the increase in net card fees was driven primarily by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in card fees across certain key international countries the increase in other fees and commissions was primarily driven by increases in delinquency fees travel commissions and foreign exchange conversion revenue net interest income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by growth in average card member loans and higher yields partially offset by higher interest expense primarily driven by higher cost of funds the growth in average card member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers as well as the inclusion of the acquired hilton portfolio the increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions total revenues net of interest expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by higher discount revenue reflecting billed business growth the increase also reflected higher net interest income primarily driven by growth in average card member loans and higher yields partially offset by higher interest expense provisions for losses provisions for losses increased in both periods primarily driven by increased card member loans provision reflecting strong loan growth and higher write offs in part due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages the increase in 2017 was additionally driven by a shift in mix towards non cobrand lending products which tend to have higher write off rates table of contents expenses marketing business development rewards and card member services expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 card member rewards expense increased 13 percent primarily driven by increased spending volumes marketing and business development expense increased 18 percent primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives and continued investments in partnerships card member services expense increased 29 percent primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits and the enhanced platinum card benefits salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by increases in payroll costs and higher technology and other servicing related costs partially offset by unrealized gains on certain equity investments total expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflecting the gains on the sales of the hfs portfolios in the prior year which were recognized as an expense reduction in other expenses higher card member rewards expense resulting from higher spending volumes and increased card member services expense resulting from higher usage of travel related benefits income tax provision decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily

equity capital profile a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets the basel iii minimum requirements were fully phased in as of january 1 2018 and the basel iii buffers were fully phased in as of january 1 2019 we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements as described in part i item 1 supervision and regulation the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act and related proposed rules may exempt certain banking organizations such as us

employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents using risk conversion factors before being allocated a risk adjusted weight off balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk weighted assets common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio calculated as common equity tier 1 capital cet1 divided by risk weighted assets cet1 is the sum of common shareholders equity adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets certain deferred tax assets as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows net unrealized gains losses on securities and derivatives and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses all net of tax tier 1 risk

effects upon adopting the current expected credit losses cecl model pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments effective january 1 2020 the federal reserve also released a statement indicating that it plans to maintain the current framework for calculating credit loss allowances on loans in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about cecl share repurchases and dividends we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans we suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios pursuant to the 2018 ccar capital plan process during the year ended december 31 2018 we returned 2 9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of 1 3 billion and share repurchases of 1 6 billion we repurchased 15 million common shares at an average price of 104 09 in 2018 these dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 41 percent of total capital generated during the year in addition during the year ended december 31 2018 we paid 80 million in dividends on 1 6 billion of non cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding for additional information on our preferred shares refer to note 17 and note 22 to the consolidated financial statements funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives while we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that the personal savings high yield savings account program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december 31 table 17 summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits table of contents we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities within 31 days prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our funding plan for the full year 2019 includes among other sources approximately 6 billion to 13 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately 4 billion to 11 billion of secured term debt issuance our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody s investor services moody s standard poor s s p and fitch ratings fitch such ratings

company inc downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs short term funding programs short term borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interest bearing overdrafts with banks our short term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of short term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december 31 2018 we had 0 8 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of 0 23 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2018 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our u s bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to 250 000 per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital level of aenb we through aenb have a direct retail deposit program american express personal savings which is our primary deposit product channel the direct retail program makes fdic insured certificates of deposit cds and high yield savings account products available directly to consumers we also source deposits through third party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of december 31 2018 we had 70 0 billion in customer deposits refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits long term debt and asset securitization programs as of december 31 2018 we had 58 4 billion in long term debt outstanding during 2018 we and our subsidiaries issued 15 9 billion of unsecured debt and asset backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 7 years refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings table of contents our 2018 long term debt and asset

liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on balance sheet and off balance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities through our u s bank subsidiary aenb we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under dodd frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market wide firm specific and combined liquidity stresses the lcr rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high quality liquid assets we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements the investment income we receive on liquidity resources is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december 31 2018 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 15 2020 which gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december 31 2018 1 5 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility which was subsequently repaid on january 15 2019 no amounts were drawn on the lending trust facility table of contents federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 70 5 billion as of december 31 2018 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december 31 2018 of 3 5 billion with a maturity date of october 16 2020 the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december 31 2018 we were in compliance with each of our covenants as of december 31 2018 no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility the capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows billions 2018 2017 2016 total cash provided by

1 0 3 0 2 net decrease increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 5 5 7 8 2 3 cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income such as provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the amount and timing of payments of accounts payable and other liabilities partially offset by an increase in net income from normal business operations cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio partially offset by less growth in card member receivables and loans cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits long term debt and short term borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a lower increase in customer deposits and long term debt partially offset by a lower level of share repurchases table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on and off balance sheet transactions arrangements obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction table 21 committed future obligations by year a the table above excludes approximately 0 7 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments if any to be made over a range of years refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information b estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of december 31 2018 and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments c as of december 31 2018 there were no minimum required contributions and no contributions are currently planned for the u s american express retirement plan for the u s american express retirement restoration plan and non u s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in 2019 are anticipated to be approximately 46 million and this amount has been included within other long term liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating 517 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other long term liabilities do not include 8 4 billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered long term liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable d as of december 31 2018 we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a 237 million unfunded commitment included in other long term liabilities in addition to this amount there was a further 59 million of contractual off balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information e the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non cancelable minimum contractual obligations as applicable by period under contracts that were in effect as of december 31 2018 f represents our estimated obligation under the tax act to pay the deemed repatriation tax on certain non us earnings over eight years refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table 21 we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement generally ranging from five to eight years we make payments to such cobrand partners primarily based on card members spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new card members in the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment we will pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points as of december 31 2018 we had 5 0 billion in such commitments outstanding we also have off balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other off balance sheet arrangements guarantees as of december 31 2018 we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately 1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees table of contents certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 302 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products the maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements however based on historical experience we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure the actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 refer to notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other off balance sheet arrangements risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief audit executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes controls talent and capabilities the board monitors the tone at the top our risk culture and oversees emerging and strategic risks the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight of our enterprise wide risk management framework processes and methodologies the risk committee approves our erm policy the erm policy governs risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite for risks including individual credit risk institutional credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk reputational risk compliance risk model risk asset liability risk and strategic and business risk risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance including stressed forward looking scenarios in addition it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits escalation triggers and assessing control programs the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks transactions and exposures the risk committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the risk appetite framework including significant risk exposures risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards our internal capital adequacy assessment process including its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar submissions and resolution planning the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors reviews and approves compliance policies which include our compliance risk tolerance statement in addition the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporate wide compliance risk management program more broadly this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process internal and external auditing including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function and the integrity of our systems of internal controls the audit and compliance committee provides oversight of our internal audit group the audit and compliance committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief audit executive and approves internal audit s annual audit plan charter policies and budget the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan s status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions table of contents the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs as well as those covering our risk taking employees appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forward looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks the compensation and benefits committee uses a risk balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives there are several internal management committees including the enterprise wide risk management committee ermc chaired by our chief risk officer the ermc is the highest level management committee to oversee all firm wide risks and is responsible for risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite it maintains the enterprise wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies company wide the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking business unit presidents our chief credit officer chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief operational risk officer and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing market liquidity and asset liability risk capital and resolution planning our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards lines of credit and term loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections externally the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ermc as appropriate the individual credit risk management policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension including prospecting new account approvals point of sale authorizations credit line management and collections the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision making models that use up to date information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus we have developed data driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our gcs gms gns and foreign exchange services businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by client specific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios table of contents similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk adjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline and travel industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines and the travel industry more broadly including cruise lines travel agencies and tour operators our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations under risk factors for additional information debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december 31 2018 we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators and d process and entity level risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers and or us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we have implemented an information security program and operating model that is designed to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction our information security program and operating model are based on the national institute of standards and technology nist cybersecurity common standards framework which consist of controls designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents the framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection response and recovery capabilities chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides governance for our information security risk management program the information security and technology oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information cyber security and technology risk management programs see a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards under risk factors for additional information table of contents privacy and data governance our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure chaired by the chief privacy officer our privacy risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our privacy program the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection notice use sharing transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non compliance with applicable laws regulations rules or standards of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate wide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed the compliance risk management committee crmc chaired by the chief compliance and ethics officer is responsible for identifying evaluating managing and escalating compliance risks the crmc has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ermc and the audit and compliance committee we have a comprehensive anti money laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the anti money laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products services client and partner relationships business activities and policies management and workplace culture or our response to unexpected events could cause sustained critical media coverage a decline in revenue or investment talent attrition litigation or government or regulatory scrutiny we view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service trust security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world s best customer experience and fundamental to our long term success our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and interest rates on liabilities such as debt and deposits foreign exchange risk arises from transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the u s dollar our asset liability management alm and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the risk committee of the board of directors or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and alm activities as well as overseeing compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payments business activities refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments table of contents as of december 31 2018 a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately 177 million this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelve month horizon generally reprice by 100 basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates in addition to parallel rate changes our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates for example movements in prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable rate u s lending receivables and loans while libor rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices commonly referred to as basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between prime and libor over the next twelve months is estimated to be 27 million we currently have approximately 45 billion of prime based variable rate u s lending receivables and loans and 27 billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations the replacement of libor as a benchmark rate can have a further detrimental impact on our libor indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market activity transfers to other benchmark curves such as the secured overnight financing rate foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways 1 card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency 2 cross currency transactions and balances from our funding activities 3 cross currency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and 4 revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december 31 2018 and 2017 foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately 29 billion and 30 billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december 31 2018 with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december 31 2018 with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately 140 million as of december 31 2018 we refined our process to forecast future earnings denominated in foreign currencies that resulted in a reclassification of certain forecasted expenses from u s dollar to foreign currencies the same sensitivity analysis as of december 31 2017 using the refined process would have been approximately 154 million to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken table of contents model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees table of contents critical accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date in estimating these losses we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve the models take into account several factors including delinquency based loss migration rates loss emergence periods and average losses and recoveries over an appropriate historical period we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member loans and receivables refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends is not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter as of december 31 2018 a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately 271 million this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency based loss migration rates or recoveries or the amount of outstanding balances may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses liability for membership rewards the membership rewards program is our largest card based rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december 31 2018 an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 113 million similarly an increase in the wac per point of 1 basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 106 million table of contents goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal multi year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples e g earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws in particular the tax act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense the estimates are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the tax act and may change due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we make and additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the u s treasury department the financial accounting standards board or others regarding the tax act refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties table of contents other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a non gaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans we believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our card member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average card member loans asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as asset backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables the loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust collectively the trusts securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting american express cards and represents the percentage of

revolving balances are included within card member loans charge cards represents cards that generally carry no pre set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month no finance charges are assessed on charge cards each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a card member s most recent credit information and spend patterns some charge card accounts have additional pay over time features that allow revolving of certain charges cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the partner is then liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partner s own loyalty program table of contents credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods and rate and fee structures discount revenue primarily represents revenue earned from fees charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement the discount fee is generally deducted from our payment for card member purchases interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans and receivables general corporate purposes and liquidity needs and is recognized as incurred interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii debt which primarily relates to interest expense on our long term financing and short term borrowings e g commercial paper federal funds purchased bank overdrafts and other short term borrowings as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long term debt interest income includes i interest on loans ii interest and dividends on investment securities and iii interest income on deposits with banks and other interest on loans assessed using the average daily balance method for card member loans and loans hfs unless the loan is classified as non accrual interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixed income securities interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts fees and other payments so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled interest income on deposits with banks and other recognized as earned and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near term funding requirements in interest bearing time deposits overnight sweep accounts and other interest bearing demand and call accounts

in periods of financial and economic stress merchant acquisition represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept american express branded cards net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs net interest yield on average card member loans a non gaap measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average card member loans computed on an annualized basis reserves and net write offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation we believe net interest yield on average card member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our card member loan portfolio net loss ratio represents the ratio of gcp charge card write offs consisting of principal resulting from authorized transactions and fee components less recoveries on card member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate card members net write off rate principal only represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business card member loans or receivables written

risks can be found in risk factors above and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission table of contents","item 1a risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10 k based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities strategic business and competitive risks difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the united states and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the united states and abroad we offer a broad array of products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products slow economic growth volatile or deteriorating economic conditions or shifts in broader consumer and business trends could change customer behaviors including spending on our cards the ability and willingness of card members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us and demand for fee based products and services political conditions prolonged or recurring government shutdowns regional hostilities social upheaval fiscal and monetary policies trade concerns and tariffs could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including travel patterns and business investment and demand for credit factors such as consumer spending and confidence unemployment rates business investment government spending trade relationships with other countries interest rates taxes energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability such factors may also cause our earnings billings loan balances credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares table of contents travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately 25 percent of our u s billed business during 2018 for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns likewise spending by small businesses and corporate clients which comprised approximately 41 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2018 depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation increases in delinquencies and write off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies unemployment rates changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our business in the united kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as brexit including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the united kingdom and other countries and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate the exit itself could negatively impact the united kingdom and other economies which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us we may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling the euro and other european currencies which could further strengthen the u s dollar adversely impacting the results of operations from our international activities in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and the european union and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes that reduce revenue as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business and financial results as of december 31 2018 the united kingdom constituted approximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business and the emea region as a whole constituted approximately 11 percent we have made changes to the structure of our business operations in europe in anticipation of brexit although the financial trade and legal implications of brexit are still uncertain and may be more severe than expected given that the final terms upon which the united kingdom will exit the eu are still not known and the lack of comparable precedent our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers paper based transactions e g cash and checks bank transfer models e g wire transfers and ach as well as evolving and growing alternative non traditional payment and financing providers if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors develop compelling value propositions for our customers and or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most countries as a result card issuers and acquirers on the visa and mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the visa and mastercard networks some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors we expect expenses such as card member rewards and card member services expenses to continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for card members including in response to increased competition spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of alternative payment systems to the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be negatively impacted for example companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets commerce related experiences mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets experiences or applications impacting our profitability on transactions the competitive value of our closed loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non traditional competitors use other new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights certain regulations such as psd2 in europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world could also diminish the value of our closed loop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers table of contents to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions we may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems more restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries for example we have partnered with delta air lines as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including the airline industry to offer benefits to card member participants competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high spending loyal customers all of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 17 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2018 card member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2018 we have partnered with delta air lines across many aspects of our business we issue cards under cobrand arrangements with delta and the delta cobrand portfolio our largest cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2018 and approximately 21 percent of worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2018 the delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from card members and discount revenue from delta and other merchants for spending on delta cobrand cards our relationships with and revenues related to delta are significant and extend beyond cobrand accounts delta is a key participant in our membership rewards program provides travel related benefits and services including airport lounge access for certain american express card members accepts american express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to eight years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise we work with our cobrand partners on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the value we deliver and evolve our relationships for the benefit of both parties we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships we may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships in addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our card member loans outstanding we regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us as competition for such relationships continues to increase we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the united states and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations under md a for additional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners the loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with costco in the united states in 2016 or as the result of a merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such as the withdrawal of american airlines in 2014 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations see our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the eu in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners table of contents we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is more focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source in recent years we experienced some reduction in our average merchant discount rate including as a result of rate pressure resulting from regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries we also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to business partners and merchants merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives and or concessions we provide to such merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives we have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietary branded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes a continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added services for merchants and card members surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases in jurisdictions allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard cards or visa and mastercard cards are not surcharged at all practices that are known as differential surcharging even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups we also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards our card members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our card members expectations and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements if surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread american express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cards in force and transaction volumes the impact could vary depending on such factors as the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied how card members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale the size and recurrence of the underlying charges and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card product network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our card members or our business we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue we have been investing in a number of growth initiatives including to attract new card members reduce card member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings there can be no assurance that our investments to acquire card members provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will continue to be effective in addition if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short term incentives rather than incentivize long term loyalty card member attrition and costs could increase increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand table of contents another way we invest in customer value is through our membership rewards program as well as other card member benefits any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of membership rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability we rely on third parties such as amazon and delta for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our card members in addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to continue to differentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and card member services expenses in the future if such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as fee based revenues or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and its attributes are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices data use and protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card members and corporate clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new card members and customers and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information and conduct by our employees and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third party vendor business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by card members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards we and third parties process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including card member travel and loyalty program data employee information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity financial results and intellectual property there are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempts hacking website defacement denial of service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems for example we and other u s financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties table of contents we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts the possibility of information and cyber security incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new technology is deployed risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary or other information including account data information the effects of which could be compounded if not detected quickly information or cyber security incidents fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation fines and response costs negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies reputational and financial damage to our brand and reduced usage and acceptance of our cards all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business the disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources successful cyberattacks data breaches disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security at other large financial institutions large retailers travel and hospitality companies or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information and cyber security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event the uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses vulnerabilities in hardware or software physical or electronic break ins or similar events service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and results of operations we rely on third party providers for acquiring customers technology platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business we rely on third party service providers merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business as outsourcing specialization of functions third party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase including with respect to mobile technologies tokenization big data and cloud storage solutions more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and handling our data for example we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of services to our customers if a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions or errors terrorism information or cyber security incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our business the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data communicated over third party networks or platforms or held by or accessible to third parties including merchants that accept our cards payment processors payment intermediaries and our third party vendors and business partners could become compromised which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards as well as costs associated with responding to such an incident for example in march 2018 we were alerted by expedia that certain customers who used expedia s orbitz platform may have been victims of a cyberattack the attack involved an orbitz platform that served as the underlying booking engine for online travel websites including amextravel com and travel booked through amex travel representatives we are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us if we are unable to negotiate for data use rights or use our data for purposes that do not benefit us which could diminish the competitive value of our closed loop the management of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control a failure to exercise adequate oversight over service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us in addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors service providers table of contents we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries including the airline industry that represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with these industries including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations and alliances of our partners and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations for example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect card members against non delivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a card member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2018 for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline and travel industry under md a if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interactions and communications alternative payment mechanisms authentication technologies and risk management and compliance systems incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology the process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry wide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card members or merchants or the complexity of our systems we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted we have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures result in unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results including as a result of write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets table of contents we may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions such as the sale to incomm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business in the united states the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards if such operations are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customers experience result in additional costs litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation joint ventures including our gbt jv and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics information or cyber security incidents including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business because of our proximity to the world trade center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our technology and systems card members in california new york florida texas and georgia account for a significant portion of u s consumer billed business and card members loans and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel related spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and health related risks in addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travel related spending if the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations card member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events the impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and misconduct by or loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we rely upon our key personnel not only for business success but also to lead with integrity to the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our company s values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ such personnel in the locations of our choice as further described in supervision and regulation compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of aenb is subject to review and oversight by the occ this regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business legal regulatory and compliance risks ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and or arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand we are a defendant in a number of actions including proposed class actions filed by merchants that challenge the non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages a description of these legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings table of contents it is possible that the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation and or arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in visa s and mastercard s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and has the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses increase our costs of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require changes to business practices and affect our relationships with partners merchants and card members regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders new laws or regulations enhanced supervision efforts or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and card members or affect retention of our key personnel such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain activities or acquisitions additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital in recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to non discrimination and honor all cards for example we have largely exited our network businesses in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu in a ruling issued on february 7 2018 the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances as a result there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our cobrand and agent relationships in their current form in the eu we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml programs similar aml requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards emerging technologies such as digital currencies could limit our ability to track the movement of funds money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities involving our cards could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us table of contents litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation and or a material adverse effect on our business businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities risks and costs associated with class action cases the continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters we have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from or served subpoenas on us seeking information relating to a small specialized part of our business known as foreign exchange international payments fxip which offers cross border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries including the united states in particular we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the u s department of justice as well as inquiries from the federal reserve the occ the cfpb the fdic and others fxip accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses relatedly we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of fxip s pricing practices we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results we expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non public supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business in addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us further a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in card member reimbursements increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions for example the basel committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements if these revisions are adopted in the united states we could be required to hold significantly more capital as a result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity as part of our required stress testing we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the severely adverse economic scenario published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rules compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources an inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our u s bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approaches implementation to the extent that the advanced approaches requirements apply to us our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach in such a case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio for more information on capital adequacy requirements see stress testing and capital planning and capital leverage and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation table of contents we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the federal reserve for review as part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment if the federal reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted in addition the capital rules include buffers that can be satisfied only with cet1 capital if our risk based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions as well as discretionary bonus payments to executive officers our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our series b and series c preferred stock american express company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state laws regulations and supervisory policy limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company for example our u s bank subsidiary aenb is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends these limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding american express company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market

effectively manage the operational conduct and compliance risks to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment e g natural disasters operational risk includes among others the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third party s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our systems we grant to third parties as processes or organizations are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes through human error fraud or malfeasance conduct risk can result in harm to customers broader markets and the company and its employees compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational conduct and compliance risks can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations table of contents if we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information these measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage in addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expenses and or pay significant monetary damages tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value added taxes vat to certain transactions while we believe we comply with all applicable vat and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities new guidance or modifications to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition unilateral or multi jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities changes in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters which could change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements even if we do not change the way in which we transact or conduct our business a change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results for more information on recently issued accounting standards see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements credit liquidity and market risks our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return we have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk asset liability risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk model risk strategic and business risk and reputational risk see risk management under md a for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective there may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected table of contents management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and or forecasting models although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused in addition issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports for example models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time if our decisions are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner we may face adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation in addition some decisions our regulators make including those related to our capital distribution plans may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient we may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member receivables and loans and institutional credit risk from corporate card member receivables and loans merchants network partners loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons general economic factors such as the rate of inflation unemployment levels and interest rates may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses country regional and political risks can also contribute to credit risk a customer s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic market political and social conditions but also a customer s other payment obligations our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations further our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses higher write off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for loan and receivable losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud in addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and re age guidance increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the united states where approximately 74 percent of our revenues were generated in 2018 increases in the level of loan balances changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition continued interest rate increases and changes to reference rates could materially adversely affect our earnings if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net income could fall our interest expense was approximately 2 9 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 177 million as of december 31 2018 we expect the rates we pay on our deposits will increase as benchmark interest rates increase in addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances card members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations as a result of recent regulatory and other legal proceedings actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which the london interbank offered rate libor is determined its discontinuance or the establishment of alternative reference rates at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate the establishment of alternative reference rates or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets us or our floating rate debt securities uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance modification alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our floating rate debt securities furthermore the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest payable on our outstanding floating rate debt securities to be materially different and potentially higher than expected for a further discussion of our interest rate risk see risk management market risk management process under md a table of contents adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital we need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from card members proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and long term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third party sourced deposits cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities a committed bank borrowing facility and the federal reserve discount window our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business in some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see consolidated capital resources and liquidity funding programs and activities under md a any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries long term and short term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital during 2018 approximately 26 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the united states we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the u s dollar including as a result of brexit which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into u s dollars or our ability to transfer them political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local card members spending outside such country and for the payment by card members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency substantial and sudden devaluation of local card members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country the occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations continuing concerns regarding the euro may cause the value of the euro to continue to fluctuate and could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely the reintroduction of certain individual country currencies a significant devaluation of the euro or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities potential developments regarding the euro could also have an adverse impact on consumer and business behavior in europe and globally which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business our u s bank subsidiary aenb accepts deposits directly from consumers through american express personal savings as well as from individuals through third party brokerage networks and uses the proceeds as a source of funding as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 69 1 billion in total u s retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through third party brokerage networks we face strong competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost effective deposit balances if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted table of contents our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on aenb s capital levels the fdia s brokered deposit provisions and related fdic rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid additionally our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business the value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition we held approximately 4 7 billion of investment securities as of december 31 2018 in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio potentially resulting in impairment charges defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us ","item 3 legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal

proceedings we do not believe we are a party to nor are any of our properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions

strategic imperatives expand our presence in the premium consumer space build on our position in commercial payments strengthen our global integrated network and make american express an essential part of our customers digital lives the increases in net income and earnings per share versus the prior year reflected growth across our businesses as well as a lower tax provision due to the reduction in the u s corporate income tax rate resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act we also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders during the quarter through the resumption of our share buyback program and an increase in our dividend our worldwide billed business increased 8 percent over the prior year our u s and international proprietary consumer card issuing businesses saw continued double digit billings growth the increase in u s consumer billings versus the prior year reflected growth in spending within our premium consumer base and strong acquisition of new card members through our digital channels commercial billings also had a double digit increase reflecting growth across all of our commercial customer segments global network services billed business declined due to the impact of the regulatory environment in the european union and australia excluding the billings from those geographies global network services billed business grew year over year revenues net of interest expense grew 9 percent reflecting higher card member spending fee income and net interest income partially offset by a year over year decline in the average discount rate this decline was less than in recent quarters as several factors that drove larger declines in the average discount rate began to moderate these factors included the impact of regulatory changes in europe and australia the continued roll out of our opt blue program to drive towards parity merchant coverage in the u s and impacts from decisions we made with respect to certain strategic partners we continue to be focused on driving discount revenue growth card member loans grew year over year in line with the first half of the year as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members including the acquisition from citibank n a of the portion of the hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own

interest expense summary table of contents total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily due to growth in billed business of 8 percent and 10 percent for the three and nine month periods respectively partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate u s billed business increased 10 percent for both periods non u s billed business increased 5 percent and 10 percent for the three and nine month periods respectively see tables 5 6 and 7 for more details on billed business performance the decreases in the average discount rate for both the three and nine month periods primarily reflected rate reductions related to merchant negotiations including rate pressure resulting from recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and the continued growth of the optblue program and additionally for the nine month period changes in industry and geographic mix we expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors net card fees increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain key international countries other fees and commissions increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue and increases in delinquency fees and travel commissions and fees other revenues decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by a modification of one of our gns arrangements and additionally in the nine month period by a decline in revenues related to the gbt jv interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by higher average card member loans and additionally in the nine month period by higher yields the growth in average card member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers as well as the inclusion of the acquired hilton portfolio the increase in yields in the nine month period was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by higher interest rates higher average deposits and higher average long term debt table 3 provisions for losses summary provisions for losses charge card provision for losses was flat and increased for the three and nine month periods respectively the increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by growth in receivables due to increased billed business and higher net write offs largely in the corporate and small business portfolios in the three month period the growth in receivables was offset by an increase in reserves in the prior year in part related to the hurricanes card member loans provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by continued strong loan growth and higher net write offs in part due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages over the past several quarters delinquency rates have stabilized resulting in a smaller increase in provision in the three month period other provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily due to growth in the non card lending portfolio table of contents table 4 expenses summary a effective january 1 2018 includes reclassification of certain business development expenses from other expenses to marketing and business development that are not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance prior periods have been conformed to the current period presentation expenses marketing and business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily due to higher spending on growth initiatives including our new global brand campaign continued investments in partnerships and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes card member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by increases in cobrand rewards expense of 91 million and 371 million and membership rewards and cash back reward expenses of 141 million and 384 million for the three and nine month periods respectively all of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants increased to 96 percent rounded up at september 30 2018 from 95 percent rounded down at september 30 2017 the increase in the urr reflects continued higher engagement in our membership rewards program card member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits in addition to enhanced platinum card benefits in the nine month period salaries and employee benefits expense increased for both the three and nine month periods respectively in part driven by increases in incentive compensation partially offset in the nine month period by lower restructuring costs other expenses decreased for both the three and nine month periods the decrease in both periods was primarily driven by charges in the prior year related to our u s loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses and current year gains on certain equity investments partially offset by a foreign exchange loss in the current period related to the devaluation of the argentine peso which was deemed a highly inflationary currency as of july 1 2018 in addition the decrease in the nine month period was further partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from a change in the liability related to non delivery of goods and services by merchants and a loss in the current year on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business income taxes the effective tax rate decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily reflecting the reduction in the u s federal statutory tax rate as a result of the tax act the tax rates in the prior year also

such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to

broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility while we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debentures asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that the personal savings high yield savings account direct retail deposit program will become a larger proportion over time summary

higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of september 30 2018 we maintained a committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which gives us the right to

drawn on this facility unused credit outstanding as of september 30 2018 we had approximately 300 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and

cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operations cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by higher growth in card member receivables and loans due in part to the acquired hilton portfolio and a larger net increase in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long term debt short term borrowings and customer deposits as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a lower increase in customer deposits partially offset by a smaller decrease in debt and a lower level of share repurchases table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations have been and will continue to be a focus of governmental authorities as well as for the company itself such reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our customers civil money penalties and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from or served subpoenas on us seeking information relating to a small specialized part of our business known as foreign exchange international payments fxip which offers cross border payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries including the united states in particular we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the u s department of justice as well as inquiries from the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bureau of consumer financial protection the federal deposit insurance corporation and others fxip accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses relatedly we are conducting a review with an outside law firm of fxip s pricing practices we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2017 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks we do not have interchange fees regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for more information on the european union and australian payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2017 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network table of contents surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been struck down for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2017 form 10 k consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2017 form 10 k antitrust litigation the u s department of justice and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws on june 25 2018 the supreme court found in favor of american express in that case we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in court and arbitration proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings below and the legal proceedings section in our 2017 form 10 k for descriptions of the cases it is possible that actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business for more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business please see the risk factors section of the 2017 form 10 k privacy data protection information and cyber security regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide we have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable laws meet evolving customer expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking denial of service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems for more information on privacy data protection and information and cyber security regulation and the potential impacts of a major information or cyber security incident

including the gbt jv effective january 1 2018 we adopted new revenue recognition guidance using the full retrospective method which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented starting january 1 2016 the adoption changed the recognition timing and classification of certain revenues and expenses including changes to the presentation of certain credit and charge card related

company act of 1956 and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment our results for the second quarter reflect strong performance that continues the momentum from the beginning of the year as we progress against our four strategic imperatives strengthening our leadership position with premium consumers extending our strong position in the commercial payments space strengthening our global integrated network and making american express an essential part of our customers digital lives the increases in net income and earnings per share versus the prior year reflected growth across our businesses as well as a lower tax provision due to the reduction in the u s corporate income tax rate resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act our worldwide billed business increased 10 percent over the prior year our u s and international proprietary consumer card issuing businesses saw continued double digit billings growth the increase in u s billings versus the prior year reflected growth from existing customers and strong growth in our platinum portfolios the increase in commercial billings reflected growth across all of our commercial customer segments global network services billed business declined due to the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in the european union and australia excluding the billings from those geographies global network services billed business grew year over year revenues net of interest expense grew 9 percent reflecting higher card member spending fee income and net interest income partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate we continue to be focused on driving discount revenue growth not on managing the average discount rate which has led us to selectively adjust discount rates in order to drive higher volume growth and overall economics while our net interest yield continued to increase year over year the increase has moderated over the last few quarters as we grow over some of our prior year pricing initiatives and experience higher funding costs card member loans grew year over year in line with the first quarter as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members including the acquisition from citibank n a of the portion of the hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own the acquired hilton portfolio provisions for losses increased as a result of higher card member loans and receivables and increases in net write off rates the increase in the lending net write off rate was primarily due to the continued seasoning of recent loan vintages and we expect this trend to continue spending on customer engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and business development expenses increased year over year across all categories growth in rewards and card member services reflected the growth in billings and continued higher levels of usage across many of our premium travel services marketing and business development expense increased due to higher spending on growth initiatives including the launch of our new global brand campaign continued investments in our cobrand partnerships and higher corporate client incentives we expect spending on growth initiatives to remain at higher levels than the first quarter of 2018 for the balance of the year operating expense decreased modestly year over year reflecting our continued focus on controlling operating costs table of contents as previously announced we suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital and as a result we saw our capital ratios sequentially improve during the second quarter we continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend distributions and during the quarter we received notice that the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve did not object to our capital plan we will therefore be resuming our share buyback program during the third quarter of the year while we continue to see some headwinds from a rising interest rate environment regulation in countries around the world and intense competition we remain focused

5 6 and 7 for more details on billed business performance the decreases in the average discount rate for both the three and six month periods primarily reflected rate reductions from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets changes in industry and geographic mix and the continued growth of the optblue program we expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors table of contents net card fees increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain key international countries other fees and commissions increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in foreign exchange conversion revenue in addition to an increase in travel commissions and fees in the three month period and a change in the late fee assessment date for certain u s charge cards in the six month period other revenues decreased for both the three and six month periods the decrease in both periods was primarily due to a reduction in revenues related to gns partners and lower revenues related to our prepaid business and additionally in the three month period by a decline in revenues related to the gbt jv interest income increased for both the three and six month periods primarily reflecting higher average card member loans and higher yields the growth in average card member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers as well as the inclusion of the acquired hilton portfolio the increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets and specific pricing actions interest expense increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by higher interest rates higher average long term debt and higher average deposits table 3 provisions for losses summary denotes a variance greater than 100 percent provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in receivables due to increased billed business and higher net losses largely in the corporate and small business portfolios card member loans provision for losses

certain business development expenses from other expenses to marketing and business development that are not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance prior periods

spending on growth initiatives including the launch of our new global brand campaign continued investments in partnerships and increased corporate client incentives driven by higher volumes card member rewards expense increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by increases in cobrand rewards expense of 152 million and 280 million and membership rewards and cash back reward expenses of 83 million and 243 million for the three and six month periods respectively all of which were primarily driven by higher spending volumes the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants increased to 96 percent rounded up at june 30 2018 from 95 percent rounded down at june 30 2017 the increase in the urr reflects continued higher engagement in our membership rewards program card member services expense increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits in addition to enhanced platinum card benefits in the six month period salaries and employee benefits expense was flat and increased for the three and six month periods respectively primarily driven by increases in incentive compensation offset in the three month period by lower restructuring costs other expenses decreased and was flat for the three and six month periods respectively the decrease in the three month period was primarily driven by foreign currency related gains and a value added tax vat reserve release partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from a change in the liability related to non delivery of goods and services by merchants the six month period also reflected a loss on a transaction involving the operations of our prepaid reloadable and gift card business income taxes the effective tax

repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are

quarterly dividend to 0 39 per share from 0 35 per share beginning with the third quarter 2018 dividend declaration subject to approval by our board of directors the timing and amount of common shares

make purchases pursuant to one or more trading plans under rule 10b5 1 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which allows us to repurchase common shares during periods when we might otherwise be prevented from doing so under applicable law or because of self imposed trading blackout periods funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility while we diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debentures asset securitizations

regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy table of contents the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of june 30 2018 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which gives us the right to

our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the increase in net

flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long term debt short term borrowings and customer deposits as well as our regular common share dividend and share repurchase programs the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a net decrease in long term debt and lower increase in customer deposits partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2017 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for more information on the european union and australian payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2017 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2017 form 10 k table of contents consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny internal and regulatory reviews to assess compliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our card members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties these types of reviews will be a continuing focus for the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as for the company itself for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2017 form 10 k antitrust litigation the u s department of justice and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card

various products and services discount revenue our largest revenue source represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold interest on loans principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees which varies based on the type of card and the number of

the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment our results for the first quarter reflect a solid start to the year as we continue to invest across our four key focus areas strengthening our leadership position with premium consumers extending our strong position in the commercial payments space making american express an essential part of our customers digital lives and strengthening our global integrated network the increase in earnings per share versus the prior year reflected growth across our businesses as well as a lower tax provision due to the reduction in the u s corporate income tax rate resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act our worldwide billed business increased 12 percent over the prior year reflecting growth across all of our customer segments and geographies our u s and international proprietary consumer card issuing businesses saw a sequential improvement in billings growth u s billings growth benefited from the acquisition from citibank n a of the portion of the hilton cobrand portfolio that we did not previously own the acquired hilton portfolio growth from existing customers and strong growth in our platinum portfolios which was driven by prior year investments commercial billings growth also accelerated driven by growth from large and global commercial customers as well as middle market and small business customers as anticipated global network services billed business grew at a slower rate than our proprietary business due to the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in europe and australia table of contents revenues net of interest expense grew reflecting higher card member spending loans and fee income partially offset by a decline in the average discount rate we are focused on driving discount revenue growth not on maximizing the average discount rate which has led us to selectively adjust such rate in order to drive higher volume growth and overall economics our net interest yield increased year over year primarily related to a shift in mix over time towards non cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates and specific pricing actions we continue to expect net interest yield to stabilize sequentially card member loans grew year over year as we continued to expand our lending relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members including the previously mentioned acquired hilton portfolio provisions for losses increased as a result of higher card member loans and receivables and increases in lending delinquencies and net write off rates the increases in the delinquencies and net write off rates were in line with our expectations and primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non cobrand lending products which have higher write off rates but also drive higher net interest yields we expect these trends relating to lending write off rates delinquencies and provisions for losses to continue spending on customer engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and business development expenses increased year over year driven in part by growth in rewards which reflects the growth in billings and continued higher levels of usage across many of our premium travel services marketing and business development expense increased due to partner payments related to our recent cobrand agreements and higher corporate client incentives we expect marketing and business development expenses to be higher over the balance of the year due to increased investments operating expense increased year over year reflecting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and a number of discrete items including a loss on a transaction related to our prepaid business operations and gains on the re measurement of certain equity investments previously held at cost as previously announced we have suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital and as a result we saw our capital ratios improve during the first quarter we continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividend distributions while we continue to see some headwinds from a rising interest rate environment regulation in countries around the world and intense competition we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants customers and business partners while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in other

results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results provide commentary on the variances for the three months ended march 31 2018 compared to same period in the prior year as presented in the accompanying tables effective january 1 2018 we changed the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead costs and interest income and expense to the operating segments prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation table 1 summary of financial performance a earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of i earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of 13 million and 10 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 and 2017 respectively and ii dividends on preferred shares of 21 million for both the three months ended march 31 2018 and 2017 table 2 total revenue net of interest expense summary total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue increased primarily due to growth in billed business partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate worldwide billed business increased by 12 percent driven by 10 percent and 17 percent increases in u s and non u s billed business respectively see tables 5 and 6 for more details on the average discount rate and billed business performance the decrease in the average discount rate primarily reflected rate reductions from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets the continued growth of the optblue program and changes in industry and geographic mix we expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors table of contents net card fees increased primarily driven by growth in certain key international countries as well as growth in the platinum and delta portfolios other fees and commissions increased primarily driven by increases in delinquency fees due to a change in the late fee assessment date for certain u s charge cards foreign exchange conversion revenue and loyalty coalition related fees other revenues increased primarily driven by an increase in the profit distribution from the gbt jv interest income increased primarily reflecting higher average card member loans and higher yields the growth in average card member loans was primarily driven by expanding relationships with existing customers as well as the inclusion of the acquired hilton portfolio the increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets specific pricing actions and a mix shift over time towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances interest expense increased primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average deposits and long term debt partially offset by fair value hedge ineffectiveness previously reported in other

generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital

the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits

risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of march 31 2018 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which

environment please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2017 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for more information on the european union and australian payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2017 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2017

business customers while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace global network services billed business grew at a slower rate over the year than our proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in europe and australia revenues net of interest expense grew year over year primarily due to growth in billed business net interest income and net card fees partially offset by an expected decline in the average discount rate our net interest yield increased year over year primarily related to a shift in mix over time towards non cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates during the fourth quarter we saw net interest yield begin to stabilize sequentially card member loan and receivables growth was strong year over year as we continue to expand our relationships with existing customers and acquired new card members we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of our customers borrowings as expected provisions for losses increased as a result of higher card member loans and receivables and increases in lending delinquencies and net write off rates the increases in the delinquencies and net write off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non cobrand lending products which have higher write off rates but also drive higher net interest yields we expect these trends to continue resulting in continued increases in lending write off rates delinquencies and provisions for losses spending on card member engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and promotion expenses increased year over year and primarily reflected the recent enhancements to rewards on our u s platinum products continued strong growth in our delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services marketing and promotion expense decreased due to elevated spending on growth initiatives during the prior year and as we realized efficiencies in our marketing spend operating expense increased year over year driven by the prior year gains on the sales of certain cobrand portfolios which were recognized as a reduction in other expenses excluding these gains operating expense decreased year over year reflecting the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives during the past two years table of contents in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a tax charge of 2 6 billion related to the tax act which drove a decline in net income versus 2016 this charge represents our current estimate of taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of u s net deferred tax assets our effective tax rate for 2017 was up substantially from 33 percent in 2016 excluding the impacts of the tax act our effective tax rate for the year would have decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and a continuing shift in the geographic mix of earnings we continue to analyze and interpret the tax act and its impact on our earnings however for 2018 we currently estimate our tax rate will be approximately 22 percent before discrete tax items the upfront charge triggered by the tax act reduced our capital ratios and as a result while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level we suspended our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital our strong performance in 2017 reflects benefits from the investments we have made in a variety of growth opportunities over the last several years although we continue to see some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants customers and business partners while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders with stephen j squeri as our new chairman and chief executive officer effective february 1 2018 as previously announced we will be focused on strengthening our leadership position with premium consumers extending our strong position in the commercial payments space making american express an essential part of our customers digital lives and strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value see supervision and regulation in business for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and legal regulatory and compliance risk in risk factors for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the department of justice case and related merchant litigations on our business table of contents consolidated results of operations effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets on march 18 2016 and june 17 2016 we completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics which did not reflect amounts related to these hfs loans and receivables as credit costs were reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield reflected amounts related to the hfs portfolios through the sale completion dates additionally for periods after the sale completion dates activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the hfs portfolios were no longer included in our consolidated results of operations specifically these impacts included discount revenue from costco in the united states for spend on all american express cards and from other merchants for spend on the costco cobrand card other fees and commissions and interest income from costco cobrand card members and card member rewards expense related to the costco cobrand card resulting in a lack of comparability between the periods presented the relationship of the u s dollar to various foreign currencies over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations where meaningful in describing our performance foreign currency adjusted amounts which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange fx rates have been provided table 1 summary of financial performance c the effective tax rate for 2017 excluding the 2 6 billion charge related to the tax act is a non gaap measure management believes the effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the tax act is useful in evaluating the company s tax rate in comparison with the prior year periods refer to note 21 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information table 2 total revenues net of interest expense summary total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in billed business and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower costco related revenues both periods of comparison also reflected decreases in the average discount rate and increases in contra discount revenues the increase in contra discount revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher corporate client incentives and cobrand partner payments both driven by higher volumes the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash rebate rewards overall billed business increased in 2017 compared to 2016 u s billed business increased 1 percent and non u s billed business increased 12 percent see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance table of contents the average discount rate was 2 43 percent 2 45 percent and 2 46 percent for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the average discount rate in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily reflected rate pressure from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets the continued growth of the optblue program and changes in industry and geographic mix we expect the average discount rate will continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors net card fees increased in both periods the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios and growth in key international markets the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the platinum gold and delta portfolios other fees and commissions increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in delinquency fees due to a change in the late fee assessment date for certain u s charge cards and an increase in foreign exchange conversion revenue the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower costco related fees partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition related fees other revenues decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease in 2017 was primarily driven by prior year revenues related to the loyalty edge business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a contractual payment from a gns partner also in the prior year 2016 included the previously mentioned contractual payment from a gns partner and higher revenues from our prepaid services business compared to 2015 offset by lower revenues related to costco loyalty edge and the gbt jv transition services agreement interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 primarily reflected higher average card member loans and higher yields the growth in average card member loans was primarily driven by a mix shift over time towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances the increase in yields was primarily driven by a greater percentage of loans at higher rate buckets specific pricing actions and increases in benchmark interest rates the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average card member loans across other lending products interest expense increased in both periods the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by higher interest rates and higher average long term debt the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances partially offset by lower average long term debt table 3 provisions for losses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates did not reflect the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by growth in receivables due to charge volume and higher net write offs the decrease in 2016 was driven by lower net write offs and improved delinquencies card member loans provision for losses increased in both periods the increases were primarily driven by strong loan growth as well as increases in net write off rates and delinquencies primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time towards non cobrand lending products which tend to have higher write off rates the increase in 2016 was partially offset by the impact of the hfs portfolios as 2016 did not reflect the associated credit costs as previously mentioned other provision for losses was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015 2017 compared to 2016 reflected growth in the non card lending portfolio which was offset by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio which resulted in higher net write offs table of contents table 4 expenses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates included the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015 the variances for both periods were primarily driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in 2016 compared to the preceding and subsequent years card member rewards expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by increases in membership rewards expense of 750 million and cobrand rewards expense of 65 million the increase in membership rewards expense was primarily driven by enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards and higher spending volumes the increase in cobrand rewards expense reflected growth in spending volumes across certain cobrand card products which more than offset the absence of costco related expense in 2017 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of 518 million primarily reflecting lower costco related expense and a shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra discount revenue partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products the lower cobrand rewards expense in 2016 was partially offset by higher membership rewards expense of 315 million primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards and less of a decline in the weighted average cost wac per point card member services and other expense increased for both periods of comparison primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits in both periods and additionally in 2017 by the enhanced platinum card benefits salaries and employee benefits expense was flat for 2017 compared to 2016 and increased in 2016 compared to 2015 salaries and employee benefits expenses for 2017 reflected higher performance related employee compensation offset by lower restructuring charges compared to the prior year the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges compared to 2015 other expense increased in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in 2017 was primarily driven by the prior year gains on the sales of the hfs portfolios which were recognized as an expense reduction partially offset by lower technology related costs in 2017 and loyalty edge related costs in the prior year the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by the previously mentioned gains on the sales of the hfs portfolios as well as goodwill and technology impairment charges in 2015 income taxes the effective tax rate for 2017 was 63 1 percent and reflects a substantial charge of 2 6 billion related to the income tax effects of the tax act which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment the 2 6 billion charge represents our current estimate of taxes primarily on the deemed repatriation of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of u s federal net deferred tax assets to the lower federal tax rate our accounting for the impacts of the tax act is provisional and amounts may be revised in future periods as described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 which was issued on december 22 2017 to provide guidance on the accounting for the effects of the tax act refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information excluding the impacts of the tax act the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 28 4 percent compared to 33 2 percent in 2016 and 35 0 percent in 2015 see table 1 for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate for 2017 on a gaap basis the tax rate for 2017 includes discrete tax benefits of 156 million related to the

related to other corporate indebtedness table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions inclusive of transition provisions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets see section on transitional basel iii the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1 2019 see section on fully phased in basel iii we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum

requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express centurion bank and american express bank to take actions that could limit our business operations due to the tax act impact of 2 6 billion we reported a net loss in the fourth quarter the net loss combined with growth in the balance sheet and continued capital return in the quarter resulted in a decline in our common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio to 9 0 percent which is below the level we had projected in the 2017 ccar process as a result we have suspended our share repurchase program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we currently expect that the portion of generated capital we allocate to support asset growth will be greater going forward than it has been historically due to projected asset growth table of contents we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level the following are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents using risk conversion factors before being allocated a risk adjusted weight off balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk weighted assets common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio calculated as common equity tier 1 capital cet1 divided by risk weighted assets cet1 is the sum of common shareholders equity adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets certain deferred tax assets as well as certain

we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the year ended december 31 2017 we returned 5 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of 1 2 billion and share repurchases of 4 3 billion we repurchased 50 million common shares at an average price of 85 56 in 2017 these dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 190 percent of total capital generated during the year as previously mentioned we decided to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital levels and ratios we intend to continue our quarterly

information on our preferred shares refer to note 17 common and preferred shares and note 22 earnings per common share eps preferred shares to the consolidated financial statements funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility table of contents we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december 31 table 21 summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits our funding plan for the full year 2018 includes among other sources approximately 6 billion to 13 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately 5 billion to 12 billion

downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs short term funding programs short term borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interest bearing overdrafts with banks our short term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of short term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december 31 2017 we had 1 2 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of 1 1 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2017 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our centurion bank and american express bank subsidiaries these funds are currently insured up to 250 000 per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital levels of centurion bank and american express bank we through american express bank have a direct retail deposit program personal savings from american express which is our primary deposit product channel the direct retail program makes fdic insured certificates of deposit cds and high yield savings account products available directly to consumers we also source deposits through third party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of december 31 2017 we had 64 5 billion in customer deposits refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

contents asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial

on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on balance sheet and off balance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities through our u s bank subsidiaries centurion bank and american express bank we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market wide firm specific and combined liquidity stresses the lcr rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high quality liquid assets we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements table of contents the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december 31 2017 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 which gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 15 2020 which gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december 31 2017 3 0 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility which was subsequently repaid on january 16 2018 no amounts were drawn on the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions centurion bank and american express bank may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 68 0 billion as of

liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december 31 2017 of 3 5 billion which expires on october 16 2020 the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december 31 2017 we were in compliance with each of our covenants as of december 31 2017 no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility the capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows billions 2017

cash equivalents 0 2 0 2 0 2 net increase in cash and cash equivalents 7 7 2 4 0 5 cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments table of contents the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the current period was driven by net income adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operations cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash used in investing activities in the current period primarily reflects growth in card member loans and receivables as well as the sales of the hfs portfolios in the prior period cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in long term debt short term borrowings and customer deposits as well as our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in the current period was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits during the current period versus a decrease in the prior period and a net increase in long term debt during the current period versus a net decrease in the prior period 62 table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on and off balance sheet transactions arrangements obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction table 25 committed future obligations by year a the table above excludes approximately 0 8 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments if any to be made over a range of years refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information b estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rates as of december 31 2017 and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments c as of december 31 2017 there were no minimum required contributions and no contributions are currently planned for the u s american express retirement plan for the u s american express retirement restoration plan and non u s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in 2017 are anticipated to be approximately 48 million and this amount has been included within other long term liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating 578 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other long term liabilities do not include 7 8 billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered long term liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable d as of december 31 2017 we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a 373 million unfunded commitment included in other long term liabilities in addition to this amount there was a further 66 million of contractual off balance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information e the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non cancelable minimum contractual obligations as applicable by period under contracts that were in effect as of december 31 2017 f represents our estimated obligation under the tax act to pay the deemed repatriation tax on certain non us earnings over eight years which has been calculated on a provisional basis refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table 25 as of december 31 2017 we had 5 6 billion in commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we make payments based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained all of which we expect will fully satisfy these commitments such cobrand agreements generally range from five to eight years we also have off balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other off balance sheet arrangements guarantees as of december 31 2017 we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately 1 billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees table of contents certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 273 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection plans that cover losses associated with purchased products the maximum potential liability related to these plans is the portion of annual billed business for which timely and valid disputes may be raised under applicable law and relevant customer agreements however based on historical experience we believe that this total amount is not representative of our actual potential loss exposure the actual amount of the potential exposure cannot be quantified as the billed business volumes which may include or result in claims under these plans are not sufficiently estimable losses related to these protection plans were immaterial for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 to mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives we accepted non cash collateral in the form of security interests in u s treasury securities from our derivatives counterparties with a fair value of 18 million as of december 31 2016 none of which was sold or repledged there was no non cash collateral held as of december 31 2017 refer to notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other off balance sheet arrangements table of contents risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief audit executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes controls talent and capabilities the board monitors the tone at the top our risk culture and oversees emerging and strategic risks the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight of our enterprise wide risk management framework processes and methodologies the risk committee approves our erm policy the erm policy governs risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite for risks including individual credit risk institutional credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk reputational risk compliance risk model risk asset liability risk and strategic and business risk risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance including stressed forward looking scenarios in addition it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits escalation triggers and assessing control programs the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks transactions and exposures the risk committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the risk appetite framework including significant risk exposures risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards our internal capital adequacy assessment process including its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar submissions and resolution planning the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors reviews and approves compliance policies which include our compliance risk tolerance statement in addition the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporate wide compliance risk management program more broadly this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process internal and external auditing including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls the audit and compliance committee provides oversight of our internal audit group the audit and compliance committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief audit executive and approves internal audit s annual audit plan charter policies and budget the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan s status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs as well as those covering our business units and risk taking employees appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals including for our business units our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forward looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks the compensation and benefits committee uses a risk balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives there are several internal management committees including the enterprise wide risk management committee ermc chaired by our chief risk officer the ermc is the highest level management committee to oversee all firm wide risks and is responsible for risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite it maintains the enterprise wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies company wide the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks table of contents as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking business unit presidents our chief credit officer chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief operational risk officer and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing market liquidity asset liability risk capital and resolution planning credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards lines of credit and loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections externally the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth which can affect customer liquidity the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy this policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension including prospecting new account approvals point of sale authorizations credit line management and collections the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision making models that use the most up to date information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus additional data such as commercial variables are integrated to further mitigate small business risk we have developed data driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our global commercial services global merchant services gns prepaid services and foreign exchange services businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by client specific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk adjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors table of contents exposure to the airline industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see risk factors debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december 31 2017 we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre implementation test metrics and d process and entity level risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers and or us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we have implemented an information security program and operating model that is designed to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction our information security program and operating model are based on the national institute of standards and technology nist cybersecurity common standards framework which consist of controls designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents the framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection response and recovery capabilities chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides governance for our information security risk management program in addition the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness the information security and technology oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information cyber security and technology risk management programs see a significant operating disruption a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards under risk factors for additional information table of contents privacy and data governance our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure chaired by the chief privacy officer our privacy risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our privacy program the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection notice use sharing transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance requirements for data used in critical processes compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non compliance with applicable laws regulations rules or standards of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate wide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed we have a comprehensive anti money laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the anti money laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products services client and partner relationships business activities and policies management and workplace culture or our response to unexpected events could cause sustained critical media coverage a decline in revenue or investment talent attrition litigation or government or regulatory scrutiny we view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service trust security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world s best customer experience and fundamental to our long term success our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and our interest rates on our liabilities such as debt and deposits and foreign exchange risk related to transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the u s dollar our asset liability management alm and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the risk committee of the board of directors or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and alm activities as well as overseeing compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payments business activities refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments table of contents as of december 31 2017 a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately 167 million this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive assets and the majority of our liabilities that reprice within the twelve month horizon generally reprice by 100 basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liabilities reprice at a lower magnitude than benchmark rate movements consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates in addition to parallel rate changes our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates for example movements in prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable rate u s lending receivables and loans while libor rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices commonly referred to as basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one month libor over the next twelve months is estimated to be 33 million we currently have approximately 44 billion of prime based variable rate u s lending receivables and loans and 33 billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations the replacement of libor as a benchmark rate can have a further detrimental impact on our libor indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market activity transfers to other benchmark curves such as the secured overnight financing rate foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways 1 card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency 2 cross currency transactions and balances from our funding activities 3 cross currency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and 4 revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december 31 2017 and 2016 foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately 30 billion and 28 billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december 31 2017 with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december 31 2017 with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately 198 million as of december 31 2017 to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve month period even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken table of contents model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees table of contents critical accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date in estimating these losses we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve the models take into account several factors including delinquency based loss migration rates loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period as well as expected future recoveries we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member loans and receivables the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends is not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter as of december 31 2017 a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately 223 million this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency based loss migration rates or recoveries or the amount of outstanding balances may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses liability for membership rewards expense the membership rewards program is our largest card based rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing promotion rewards and card member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december 31 2017 an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 103 million similarly an increase in the wac per point of 1 basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 98 million table of contents fair value measurement our investment securities and derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets which require management to make assumptions and apply judgments when assessing fair value the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability by utilizing the three level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value when available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value level 1 if quoted market prices are not available we will measure fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs level 2 we do not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level 3 for additional information on our fair value hierarchy refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements investment securities our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed income securities issued by states and municipalities in the united states the u s government and its agencies and select foreign governments the fair value of our investment securities including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets are obtained primarily from third party pricing services the fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services used as of december 31 2017 and 2016 for additional information on our investment securities refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements the fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated internally by using third party pricing models where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets for additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in the measurement of fair value for our investment securities and derivative instruments although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are based on observable markets inputs the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs or how they are modeled could result in a different estimate of fair value while we rely on the third party pricing model we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal multi year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples e g earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions table of contents income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws in particular the tax act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provisions to estimate the impact on our income tax expense the estimates are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the tax act and may change due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we make and additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the u s treasury department the financial accounting standards board or others regarding the tax act our accounting for the impacts of the tax act is provisional and actual income tax expense could differ from our estimates refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties table of contents other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a non gaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans we believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our card member loan portfolio and it is a component of net interest yield on average card member loans asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as asset backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables the loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust collectively the trusts securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards it represents the percentage of billed business generated from both proprietary and gns card member spending retained by us from merchants we acquire or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf net of amounts retained by such third party basic cards

charge cards as well as any card related fees charge cards represents cards that generally carry no pre set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month no finance charges are assessed on charge cards each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a card member s most recent credit information and spend patterns some charge card accounts have additional pay over time features that allow revolving of certain charges table of contents cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained in some cases the partner is liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partner s own loyalty program credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods and rate and fee structures discount revenue represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement the discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for card member purchases discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants payments to third party card issuing partners cash back reward costs and statement credits corporate incentive payments and other similar items interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans and receivables general corporate purposes and liquidity needs and is recognized as incurred interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii debt which primarily relates to interest expense on our long term financing and short term borrowings e g commercial paper federal funds purchased bank overdrafts and other short term borrowings as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long term debt interest income includes i interest on loans ii interest and dividends on investment securities and iii interest income on deposits with banks and other interest on loans assessed using the average daily balance method for card member loans and loans hfs unless the loan is

written off interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixed income securities interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts fees and other payments so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled interest income on deposits with banks and other recognized as earned and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near term funding requirements in interest bearing time deposits overnight sweep accounts and other interest bearing

liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress merchant acquisition represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept american express branded cards net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs net interest yield on average card member loans a non gaap measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average card member loans computed on an annualized basis reserves and net write offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation we believe net interest yield on average card member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our card member loan

penalties an increase in card member reimbursements restructurings impairments and changes in reserves the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and manage operating expense growth the amount we spend on card member engagement and our ability to drive growth from such investments changes in interest rates beyond current expectations including the impact of hedge

actions we may take as a result of the tax act our geographic mix of income further changes in tax laws and regulation unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items and the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications our ability to grow revenues net of interest expense and maintain billings momentum which could be impacted by among other things weakening economic conditions in the united states or internationally a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of card members to sustain and grow spending continued growth of card member loans a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected the strengthening of the u s dollar more cautious spending by large and global corporate card members the willingness of card members to pay higher card fees lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated and will depend on factors such as our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing our strategies and business initiatives including growing profitable spending from existing and new card members increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards competition for cobrand relationships competition from new and non traditional competitors and the success of marketing promotion or rewards programs the erosion of the average discount rate by a greater amount than anticipated including as a result of changes in the mix of spending by location and industry merchant negotiations including merchant incentives concessions and volume related pricing discounts competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates in the european union and elsewhere a greater shift of existing merchants into the optblue program and other factors our delinquency and write off rates and growth of provisions for losses being higher than current expectations which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances and delinquencies mix of loan balances loans and receivables related to new card members and other borrowers performing as expected credit performance of new and enhanced lending products unemployment rates the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written off loans our ability to continue to grow loans faster than the industry which may be affected by increasing competition brand perceptions and reputation our ability to manage risk in a growing card member loan portfolio and the behavior of card members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products offer attractive non card lending products capture a greater share of existing card members spending and borrowings reduce card member attrition and attract new customers table of contents our net interest yield on average card member loans not remaining consistent with current levels which will be influenced by among other things interest rates changes in consumer behavior that affect loan balances such as paydown rates card member acquisition strategy product mix cost of funds credit actions including line size and other adjustments to credit availability potential pricing changes and deposit rates which could be impacted by among other things changes in benchmark interest rates competitive pressure and regulatory constraints rewards expense and cost of card member services growing inconsistently from expectations which will depend in part on card member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns including the level of spend in bonus categories and the redemption of rewards and offers as well as the degree of interest of card members in the value proposition we offer increasing competition which could result in greater rewards offerings our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to card members and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion the actual amount to be spent on card member engagement which will be based in part on management s assessment of competitive opportunities overall business performance and changes in macroeconomic conditions the actual amount of advertising and card member acquisition costs our ability to continue to shift card member acquisition to digital channels contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments management s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments which could be impacted by business regulatory or legal complexities and our ability to realize efficiencies optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending our ability to manage operating expense growth which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses such as consulting or professional fees including as a result of increased litigation compliance or regulatory related costs or fraud costs continuing to implement and achieve benefits from reengineering plans which could be impacted by factors such as an inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions and underestimating hiring and other employee needs higher than expected employee levels the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs the payment of civil money penalties disgorgement restitution non income tax assessments and litigation related settlements impairments of goodwill or other

business which will be impacted in part by competition brand perceptions and reputation and our ability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to current cobrand card members and new customers and offer attractive services and rewards programs which will depend in part on ongoing investment in marketing and promotion expenses new product innovation and development card member acquisition efforts and enrollment processes including through digital channels and infrastructure to support new products services and benefits changes affecting our plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases which will depend on factors such as the pace at which we are able to rebuild our capital levels including from earnings and a lower effective tax rate the approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies and our results of operations and economic environment in any given period implementation of legislation and additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the u s treasury department state and foreign taxing authorities the financial accounting

restrict our access to the capital markets legal and regulatory developments including with regard to broad payment system regulatory regimes actions by the cfpb and other regulators and the stricter regulation of financial institutions which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices including our ability to continue certain gns and other partnerships exert further pressure on the average discount rate and gns volumes result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight litigation related settlements judgments or expenses restitution to card members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock or result in harm to the american express brand uncertainty relating to the ultimate outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed against us by the u s department of justice and certain state attorneys general including the review of the case by the u s supreme court and the impact on existing private merchant cases and potentially additional litigation and or arbitrations table of contents our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations which will depend on various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities we offer regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners such as bankruptcies restructurings or consolidations including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business such as

and factors beyond our control such as fire power loss disruptions in telecommunications severe weather conditions natural disasters health pandemics terrorism cyber attacks or fraud any of which could significantly affect demand for and spending on american express cards delinquency rates loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions a further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in risk factors above and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission table of contents","item 1a risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10 k based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities strategic business and competitive risks difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the united states and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the united states and abroad we offer a broad array of products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us political conditions in certain regions or countries could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including in other parts of the world factors such as consumer spending and confidence unemployment rates business investment government spending interest rates taxes including the broad and complex changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act to the u s tax code fuel and other energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability such factors may also cause our earnings billings loan balances credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares table of contents travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately 25 percent of our u s billed business during 2017 for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns likewise spending by small businesses and corporate clients which comprised approximately 40 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2017 depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation increases in delinquencies and write off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies unemployment rates changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a negative impact on our results of operations the consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers paper based transactions e g cash and checks bank transfer models e g wire transfers and ach as well as evolving and growing alternative non traditional payment and financing providers we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most countries as a result card issuers and acquirers on the visa and mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the visa and mastercard networks some of our competitors have developed or may develop for example as a result of the recent reduction in the u s corporate tax rate substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors we expect expenses such as card member rewards and card member services expenses to continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for card members including in response to increased competition spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of alternative payment systems to the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be negatively impacted the competitive value of our closed loop data may also be diminished as traditional and non traditional competitors use other new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors develop compelling value propositions for our customers and or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions in addition companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices through digital wallets commerce related experiences mobile applications or other technologies or at the point of sale could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets experiences or applications impacting our profitability on transactions laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes more restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure see ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products table of contents we face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries for example we have partnered with delta air lines as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including the airline industry to offer benefits to card member participants competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high spending loyal customers our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 16 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2017 card member loans related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2017 delta cobrand accounts our largest cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2017 and approximately 21 percent of worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2017 our relationships with and revenues related to delta extend beyond cobrand accounts and include merchant acceptance of american express cards participation in our membership rewards program and travel related benefits and services cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to eight years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships in addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in a significant decline in our card member loans outstanding for example our u s cobrand relationship with costco ended in 2016 and we sold the outstanding card member loans associated with the costco portfolio we also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships continues to increase we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the united states and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks we may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationships the loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners or the loss of business partners altogether whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with costco in the united states in 2016 or as the result of a merger or otherwise such as the withdrawal of american airlines in 2014 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source in recent years we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure including as a result of regulatory mandated reductions to competitors pricing to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives we also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives and or concessions we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives we also expect further erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we seek to increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietary branded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes table of contents a continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results if the average merchant discount rate declines more than expected we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volumes increasing other sources of revenue such as fee based revenue or interest income or both we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added services for merchants and card members surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups in jurisdictions allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard cards or visa and mastercard cards are not surcharged at all practices that are known as differential surcharging even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant we also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards our card members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our card members expectations and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements if surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread american express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cards in force and transaction volumes the impact could vary depending on such factors as the manner in which a surcharge is levied how card members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other payment cards including whether it varies depending on the type of card network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our card members if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics customer interactions and communications alternative payment mechanisms authentication technologies and risk management and compliance systems incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services the process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for industry wide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card members or merchants or the complexity of our systems table of contents we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing loan balances we have been investing in a number of growth initiatives over the past several years including to attract new card members reduce card member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings there can be no assurance that our investments to acquire card members provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will be effective for example we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced cards or customers may not accept or be willing to pay for our new products and services which would negatively impact our results of operations in addition if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short term incentives rather than incentivize long term loyalty card member attrition and costs could increase increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer another way we invest in customer value is through our membership rewards program as well as other card member benefits any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of membership rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to continue to differentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and card member services expenses in the future if such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as fee based revenues or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and its attributes are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card members and corporate clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new card members and customers and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third party vendor merchant acquirer or gns partner may be attributed by card members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability a significant operating disruption a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards we and other third parties process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid and other products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees table of contents global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation hacking denial of service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems for example we and other u s financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy or manipulate various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including card member travel and loyalty program account information employee information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity financial results and intellectual property there are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites as outsourcing specialization of functions third party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase including with respect to mobile technologies tokenization big data and cloud storage solutions more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by or accessible to third parties including merchants that accept our cards payment processors and our business partners may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident in addition high profile data breaches such as the one announced in 2017 by equifax one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the united states could change consumer behaviors impact our ability to access data to make product offers and credit decisions and result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts the possibility of information and cyber security incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely risks associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary or other information including account data information or negative impact to online accounts and systems these risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed for example with the increased use of emv technology we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempts our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or similar events service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed countries could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those countries if our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our cards customer online accounts or systems were to rise due to an information or cyber security incident at a business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response costs greater concerns of customers and or business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and have a material adverse impact on our business if such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded information or cyber security incidents and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security including leaked business data may also disrupt our operations undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies successful cyberattacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions large retailers or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information and cyber security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event table of contents we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries including the airline industry that represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with these industries including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations and alliances of our partners and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations for example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry which accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2017 to the extent we protect card members against non delivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a card member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline industry under md a we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted we have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures result in unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results including as a result of write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets we may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions such as the sale to incomm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business in the united states which is still subject to final agreement on the program management and issuer processing arrangements if that transaction is consummated we could experience disruption in our ability to service our prepaid customers if incomm s services are interrupted suspended or terminated for any reason which could result in additional costs regulatory risks and harm to our business and reputation joint ventures including our gbt jv and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand we rely on third party providers for acquiring customers technology platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business we rely on third party service providers merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators gns partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business for example we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of services to our customers if a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions or errors terrorism information or cyber security incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our business there is also a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by or accessible to third parties or communicated over third party networks or platforms could become compromised which could significantly harm our business even if the attack or breach does not impact our systems we are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a service provider to one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us if we are unable to negotiate for data use rights or use our data for purposes that do not benefit us which could diminish the competitive value of our closed loop table of contents the management of multiple third party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control a failure to exercise adequate oversight over third party service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us in addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors service providers our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics information or cyber security incidents including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business because of our proximity to the world trade center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 in 2017 hurricanes impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our technology and systems card members in california new york florida texas and georgia account for a significant portion of u s consumer billed business and card members loans and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel related spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and health related risks in addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travel related spending if the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations card member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events the impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our business in the united kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as brexit including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the united kingdom and other countries and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate we may experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro further strengthening the u s dollar which could continue to adversely impact our results of operations from our international activities the exit itself could also have a negative impact on the united kingdom and other european economies which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us as of december 31 2017 the emea region constituted approximately 11 percent of our worldwide billed business it is unclear at this stage the financial trade and legal implications of brexit although we expect to make changes to the structure of our business operations in europe as a result our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we rely upon our key personnel not only for business success but also to lead with integrity to the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our company s values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ such personnel in the locations of our choice as further described in supervision and regulation compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of our u s bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the fdic and the occ this regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business table of contents legal regulatory and compliance risks ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws following a non jury trial in the case the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction following our appeal of this judgment the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for american express eleven of the 17 states that are party to the case filed a petition with the supreme court seeking a review of the second circuit s decision on october 16 2017 the supreme court granted certiorari and oral argument is scheduled for february 26 2018 we are also a defendant in a number of actions and arbitration proceedings including proposed class actions filed by merchants that challenge the non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages a description of these legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings an adverse outcome in these proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation and or arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in visa s and mastercard s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and has the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses increase our costs of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require changes to business practices affect our relationships with partners merchants and card members or make our products and services more expensive for customers regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders new laws or regulations enhanced supervision efforts or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and card members or affect retention of our key personnel such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain activities or acquisitions additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital in recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations extend to certain aspects of our business such as gns and cobrand arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to non discrimination and honor all cards for example regulations in the eu and australia have undermined our gns business in those jurisdictions and have resulted in the moderation of gns billed business growth in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee cap provisions and other provisions might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu following a ruling from the eu court of justice and there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain such relationships in their current form table of contents we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml programs similar aml requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions u s federal law regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny our ability to recover debt we had previously written off may be limited which could have a negative impact on our results of operations various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation and or a material adverse effect on our business businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future the continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters we have been subject to regulatory actions by the cfpb and other regulators and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in card member reimbursements increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non public supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements including those imposed by the capital rules the lcr the nsfr or by regulators in implementing other portions of the basel iii framework and the enhanced supervision requirements of dodd frank could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions for example the basel committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements if these revisions are adopted in the united states we could be required to hold significantly more capital as a result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity as part of our required stress testing both internally and by the federal reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rules compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules including the capital rules and the lcr requires a material investment of resources an inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the company and our u s bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators table of contents we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approaches implementation depending on how the advanced approaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach in such a case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio for more information on capital adequacy requirements see capital leverage and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the federal reserve for review as part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment if the federal reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted in addition the capital rules include a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the federal reserve in the future these buffers can be satisfied only with cet1 capital if our risk based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions as well as discretionary bonus payments to executive officers a failure to increase dividends along with our competitors or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of american express our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our series b and series c preferred stock american express company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company in particular our u s bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on their declaration and payment of dividends these limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding american express company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives for more information

security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and or use personal information as privacy data protection and information and cyber security laws including data localization authentication and account access laws are interpreted and applied compliance costs may increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place in recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information security in the united states and in various countries in which we operate in addition state and federal legislators and or regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security related practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer and or employee information and some of our current or planned business activities new legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives moreover the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost compliance with current or future privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws relating to consumer and or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed loop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and or governmental investigations and or actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand table of contents we may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment e g natural disasters operational risk includes among others the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third party s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our systems we grant to third party service providers as processes or organizations are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational and compliance risks can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations if we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information these measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage in addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expenses and or pay significant monetary damages tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value added taxes vat to certain transactions while we believe we comply with all applicable vat and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities for example the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act in the united states resulted in a 2 6 billion charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 representing our current estimate of taxes primarily on the deemed repatriation of certain overseas earnings and the remeasurement of u s deferred tax assets and liabilities in addition unilateral or multi jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities changes in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions even if we do not change the way in which we transact a change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results for more information on recently issued accounting standards see note 1 to our consolidated

policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective there may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and or forecasting models although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused if our decisions are based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we may face adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation in addition some decisions our regulators make including those related to our capital distribution plans may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient we may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member receivables and loans and institutional credit risk from merchants gns partners gcs clients loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons country regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses we are continuing to experience relatively low delinquency and write off rates but expect that these rates will increase over time higher write off rates and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud in addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the united states where approximately 74 percent of our revenues are generated increases in the level of loan balances changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net income could fall our interest expense was approximately 2 1 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 167 million as of december 31 2017 we expect the rates we pay on our deposits will increase as benchmark interest rates increase in addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances card members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations for a further discussion of our interest rate risk see risk management market risk management process under md a table of contents adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital we need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from card members cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and long term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third party sourced deposits securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities a committed bank borrowing facility and the federal reserve discount window our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business in some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see consolidated capital resources and liquidity funding programs and activities under md a any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries long term and short term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital during 2017 approximately 26 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the united states we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the u s dollar which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into u s dollars or our ability to transfer them political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local card members spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by card members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency substantial and sudden devaluation of local card members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country the occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations continuing concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely if there is a significant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro the value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into u s dollars for inclusion in our financial statements similarly the reintroduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities the reintroduction of individual country currencies would require us to reconfigure our billing and other systems to reflect individual country currencies in place of the euro implementing such changes could be costly and failures in the currency reconfiguration could cause disruptions in our normal business operations in addition foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge our market exposure to re introduced currencies may not be immediately available or may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us the potential developments regarding europe and the euro or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could continue to have an adverse impact on consumer and business behavior in europe and globally which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations table of contents an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business our u s bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third party brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through american express personal savings and use the proceeds as a source of funding as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 63 7 billion in total u s retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through third party brokerage networks we face strong competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost effective deposit balances if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our u s bank subsidiaries the fdia s brokered deposit provisions and related fdic rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid see prompt corrective action under supervision and regulation for additional information while centurion bank and american express bank were considered well capitalized as of december 31 2017 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition the capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity additionally our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses including the interest rates we pay on deposits an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business the value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition we held approximately 3 2 billion of investment securities as of december 31 2017 in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio potentially resulting in impairment charges defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us ","item 3 legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims investigations

in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of the

varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account other fees and commissions represent foreign currency conversion fees charged to card members card member delinquency fees

governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment our results for the third quarter reflect significant progress against our current priorities of accelerating revenue growth optimizing investments and resetting the cost base during the quarter revenue and earnings performance was strong across our business segments and we continued to invest in new products and benefits maintaining high levels of new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network in addition our strong balance sheet position allowed us to continue to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our worldwide billed business increased 8 percent over the prior year reflecting growth across our diverse customer segments and geographies our u s and international proprietary card issuing businesses saw a modest acceleration in billings growth in the current quarter we also continued to see strong performance from middle market and small business customers while large and global commercial customers continued to grow at a more modest pace billed business growth for global network services slowed slightly from last quarter as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in europe and australia revenues net of interest expense grew year over year primarily due to strong growth in billed business and an increase in net interest income our net interest yield increased year over year primarily related to a shift in mix towards non cobrand lending products that generally attract more revolving loan balances a lower percentage of total loans at introductory interest rates specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates we expect the net interest yield to stabilize over time and as a result we expect the growth in net interest income to moderate card member loan and receivables growth was strong year over year as we continue to expand our relationships with existing customers and acquire new card members provisions for losses increased as a result of higher card member loans and receivables expected increases in delinquencies and net write off rates and a small reserve build related to recent hurricanes the increases in the delinquency and net write off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix towards non cobrand lending products which have higher write off rates we expect as a result of these trends provisions for losses will continue to grow faster than loans spending on card member engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and promotion expenses increased year over year and primarily reflected the recent enhancements to rewards on our u s platinum products continued strong growth in our delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services marketing and promotion expenses decreased as we realized efficiencies in our marketing spend year over year operating expenses were flat in the third quarter of 2017 we incurred impairment and other charges related to our us loyalty coalition and us prepaid businesses excluding these charges and a restructuring charge in the prior year adjusted operating expenses decreased year over year reflecting progress against our cost reduction initiatives our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26 percent down from 34 percent a year ago primarily due to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and a continuing shift in the geographic mix of earnings going forward we estimate our ongoing tax rate will be approximately 32 although the effective tax rate in any given period can be further impacted by discrete tax items as we saw in the current quarter table of contents our third quarter results continue to reflect the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies the momentum seen in our results throughout 2017 reflects the investments we have made in a variety of growth opportunities over the last several years although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants customers and business partners while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders on october 18 2017 we announced that the board of directors appointed stephen j squeri chief

regulatory and other developments in other matters for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 32 table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco wholesale corporation costco and jetblue airways corporation jetblue collectively the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables held for sale hfs on the consolidated balance sheets on march 18 2016 and june 17 2016 we completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics which do not reflect amounts related to these hfs loans and receivables as credit costs were reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios through the sale completion dates additionally for periods after the sale completion dates activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the hfs portfolios are no longer included in our consolidated results of operations specifically these impacts include discount revenue from costco in the united states for spend on all american express cards and from other merchants for spend on the costco cobrand card other fees and commissions and interest income from costco cobrand card members and card member rewards expense related to the costco cobrand card resulting in a lack of comparability between 2017 and 2016 in the first half of the year the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results provide commentary on the variances for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2017 compared to same periods in the prior year as presented in the accompanying tables table 1 summary of financial performance a earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of i earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of 11 million and 9 million for the three months ended september 30 2017 and 2016 respectively

contents total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily due to growth in billed business of 8 percent and 3 percent for the three and nine month periods respectively partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and increases in contra discount revenues the increase in contra discount revenue was primarily due to higher corporate client incentives and cobrand partner payments both driven by higher volumes u s billed business increased 7 percent and decreased 1 percent for the three and nine month periods respectively non u s billed business increased 10 percent and 11 percent for the three and nine month periods respectively see tables 5 6 and 7 for more details on billed business performance the decreases in the average discount rate for both the three and nine month periods primarily reflected changes in industry and geographic mix rate pressure from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international markets and the continued growth of the optblue program we expect the average discount rate will likely continue to decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors net card fees increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain key international markets other fees and commissions increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by an increase in delinquency fees due to a change in certain u s charge card portfolios late fee assessment date other revenues decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by revenues related to our loyalty edge business in the prior year and additionally in the nine month period a contractual payment from a gns partner in the prior year interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in average card member loans and higher yields in the current year the increase in yields was primarily driven by a mix shift towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances as well as a lower percentage of loans at introductory rates specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by marginally higher interest rates and higher average long term debt table 3 provisions for losses summary denotes a variance greater than 100 percent a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates does not reflect the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in receivables due to charge volume and higher net write offs card member loans provision for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by strong loan growth as well as increases in delinquencies and net write off rates primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix towards non cobrand lending products which have higher write off rates other provision for losses increased for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period the increase in the three month period was primarily due to growth in the non card lending portfolio which was more than offset in the nine month period by improving credit performance in the commercial financing portfolio table of contents table 4 expenses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the portfolio sale completion dates includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily due to lower spending on growth initiatives card member rewards expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by increases in membership rewards expense of 202 million and cobrand rewards expense of 132 million for the three month period and an increase in membership rewards expense of 674 million partially offset by a decrease in cobrand rewards expense of 75 million for the nine month period the increases in membership rewards expense were primarily driven by enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards and higher spending volumes the increase in cobrand rewards expense in the three month period reflected growth in spending volumes across cobrand card products which was more than offset in the nine month period by the impact of costco related expenses in the prior year the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants was 95 percent rounded down at both september 30 2017 and 2016 card member services and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by higher usage of travel related benefits and the enhanced platinum card benefits salaries and employee benefits expenses were flat for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period the decrease in the nine month period reflected higher restructuring charges in the prior year and benefits from our cost reduction initiatives in the current year other expenses were flat for the three month period and increased for the nine month period the three month period results were primarily driven by lower technology related costs in the current year and loyalty edge related costs included in the prior year offset by current year charges related to our u s loyalty coalition and prepaid businesses the increase in the nine month period was primarily driven by the prior year gains on the sale of the hfs portfolios partially offset by the previously mentioned lower technology related costs in the current year and loyalty edge related costs in the prior year income taxes the effective tax rate decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily reflecting the realization of certain foreign tax credits and the geographic mix of business and

issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to consumers in the united states including consumer travel services non interest revenues increased for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period primarily driven by discount revenue which increased 74 million for the three month period reflecting an increase in billed business of 6 percent and decreased 251 million for the nine month period reflecting a decrease in billed business of 6 percent the decreases in both discount revenue and billed business in the nine month period were driven by costco related volumes included in the prior year net card fees and other fees and commissions increased in both periods driven primarily by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios and higher delinquency fees respectively net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by growth in average card member loans and higher yields partially offset by higher interest expense primarily driven by marginally higher cost of funds provisions for losses increased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by card member loans provision which increased 168 million and 345 million in the three and nine month periods respectively due to strong loan growth as well as increases in delinquencies and higher net write off rates primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix towards non cobrand lending products which have higher write off rates marketing promotion rewards card member services and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods reflecting higher card member rewards and card member services and other expenses in both periods partially offset by lower marketing and promotion expenses in both periods card member rewards expense increased 168 million and 123 million for the three and nine month periods respectively primarily driven by enhancements to platinum rewards and increased spending volumes partially offset in the nine month period by costco related expenses in the prior year card member services and other expenses increased 48 million and 104 million for the three and nine month periods respectively driven by higher usage of travel related benefits and enhanced platinum card benefits marketing and promotion expenses decreased 50 million and 12 million for the three and nine month periods respectively due to lower spending on growth initiatives table of contents salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses decreased for the three month

could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs table of contents liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of september 30 2017 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2020 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face

established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity

include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments net cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of 3 9 billion and 4 6 billion for the current and prior periods respectively adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the prior period net income includes gains of 1 2 billion on the sales of the hfs portfolios which are presented in net increase decrease in card member receivables and loans including held for sale within cash flows from investing activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the periods of comparison was also driven by impacts from movements in other receivables and accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal

and receivables hfs along with gains on sales related thereto as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities primarily reflected the sale of the hfs portfolios in the prior period as well as growth in card member loans and receivables and a higher increase in restricted cash in the current period cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits during the current period versus a decrease in the prior period and net long term debt issuances during the current period versus net long term debt repayments during the prior period table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2016 the 2016 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for example the eu regulation might apply price caps as well as other regulatory measures in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of that part of the regulation as a precursor to the court s final ruling an advisory opinion was issued on july 6 2017 advising the court that a the case should be declared inadmissible and b if the court determines to treat the case as admissible the law should be considered valid and applicable the advisory opinion is not binding on the court and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of our legal challenge for more information on the european union payments legislation our related legal challenge and the australia payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction on july 19 2017 the u k indicated it would ban surcharging on consumer cards starting january 2018 in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups table of contents for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2016 form 10 k consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny internal and regulatory reviews to assess compliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our card members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties these types of reviews will be a continuing focus for the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as for the company itself as an example federal banking regulators announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are cooperating with regulators in those reviews also in august 2017 we announced that certain of our subsidiaries signed a consent order with the cfpb to resolve issues related to a previously disclosed internal review of our card product offerings in puerto rico the u s virgin islands and other u s territories on july 10 2017 the cfpb issued a final rule that among other changes would prohibit providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using a pre dispute arbitration agreement to bar consumers from filing or participating in a class action the rule would apply to agreements entered into on or after march 19 2018 as a result of the rule we may face increased class claims and therefore be subject to the complexities and costs associated with class action litigation given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some class action matters there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of this rule for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws we continue to vigorously defend this and similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings below and the legal proceedings section in our 2016 form 10 k for descriptions of the doj and related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business for more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business please see the risk factors section of

environment our results for the second quarter continue to reflect solid progress against our current priorities of accelerating revenue growth optimizing investments and resetting the cost base billed business and revenue for the second quarter increased slightly while net income was down the prior year quarter included revenues and expenses related to the costco wholesale corporation costco relationship in the u s that has since been discontinued the gain from the sale of the related loan portfolio and a restructuring charge during the current quarter our strong balance sheet position allowed us to continue to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our worldwide billings adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates increased and after excluding costco related billings from the prior year grew consistent with the first quarter reflecting growth across our diverse customer segments and geographies we continued to see strong performance from middle market and small business customers while spending by large corporations was up only slightly compared to last year internationally our consumer and small business billings growth rates remained strong revenues net of interest expense increased slightly year over year on a reported basis excluding costco related revenues in the prior year and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew primarily due to an increase in net interest income and higher adjusted billed business as well as higher net card fees across our premium card portfolios our net interest yield increased year over year due to a mix shift towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances as well as a lower percentage of loans at introductory rates specific pricing actions and a benefit from increases in benchmark interest rates card member loan and receivable growth was strong year over year as we continue to grow loans from existing customers as well as through the acquisition of new card members provisions for losses increased as expected as a result of higher card member loans and receivables as well as a slight increase in delinquencies and higher net write off rates these rates increased primarily due to the seasoning of loans related to newer card members and a shift towards non cobrand lending products which have slightly higher write off rates we expect as a result of these trends provisions for losses will continue to grow faster than loans during the balance of the year spending on card member engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and promotion expenses increased year over year and primarily reflected the recent enhancements to rewards on our u s platinum products continued strong growth in our delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the costco cobrand portfolio sale gain in the prior year which was classified as an expense reduction in other expenses excluding the gain and the restructuring charge in the prior year adjusted operating expenses decreased reflecting progress against our cost reduction initiatives the momentum in the first half of the year reflects the investments we have made in a variety of growth opportunities over the last several years although competition remains intense and the regulatory environment is uncertain we remain focused on delivering differentiated value to our merchants customers and business partners while delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in other matters for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco and jetblue airways corporation jetblue collectively the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets on march 18 2016 and june 17 2016 we completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics which do not reflect amounts related to these hfs loans and receivables as credit costs were reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios through the sale completion dates additionally for periods after the sale completion dates activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the hfs portfolios are no longer included in our consolidated results of operations specifically these impacts include discount revenue from costco in the united states for spend on all american express cards and from other merchants for spend on the costco cobrand card other fees and commissions and interest income from costco cobrand card members and card member rewards expense related to the costco cobrand card resulting in a lack of comparability between 2017 and 2016 the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results provide commentary on the variances for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 compared to same periods in the prior year as presented in the accompanying tables table 1 summary of financial performance table 2 total revenue net of interest expense summary table of contents total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue was flat for the three month period and decreased slightly for the six month period primarily driven by costco related revenue included in the prior year substantially offset by billed business growth across other card products in the current periods worldwide billed business was flat for both the three and six month periods u s billed business decreased 4 percent and 5 percent for the three and six month periods respectively primarily driven by costco related volumes in the prior year non u s billed business increased 9 percent and 11 percent for the three and six month periods respectively see tables 5 6 and 7 for more details on billed business performance the increase in the average discount rate for both the three and six month periods primarily reflected the absence of costco merchant volumes in the current year which were at a lower discount rate than the average partially offset by rate pressure from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in the european union changes in industry and regional mix and the continued growth of the optblue program we expect the average discount rate will likely decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts and certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates net card fees increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in the platinum and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain key international markets other fees and commissions increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by an increase in delinquency fees as a result of a change in the date on which late fees are assessed on our u s consumer charge cards partially offset by costco related fees in the prior year other revenues decreased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by a contractual payment from a gns partner and revenues related to our loyalty edge business both in the prior year interest income increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in average card member loans and higher yields in the current year partially offset by costco cobrand related interest income included in the prior year interest expense increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by marginally higher interest rates and higher average long term debt table 3 provisions for losses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates does not reflect the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by growth in charge volume in the gcs segment and higher net write offs card member loans provision for losses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives as well as a slight increase in delinquencies and higher net write off rates primarily due to the seasoning of loans related to newer card members and a shift towards non cobrand lending products which have slightly higher write off rates table of contents other

variance greater than 100 percent a beginning december 1 2015 through to the portfolio sale completion dates includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses increased marginally during the three month period and were relatively flat during the six month period card member rewards expenses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by an increase in membership rewards expense of 243 million and 472 million for the three and six month periods respectively partially offset by a reduction in cobrand rewards expense of 84 million and 208 million for the same respective periods the increases in membership rewards expense were primarily driven by enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards and higher spending volumes the decreases in cobrand rewards expense reflected costco related expenses in the prior year partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products in the current periods the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants was 95 percent rounded down at both june 30 2017 and 2016 card member services and other expenses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by higher usage of cobrand travel related benefits and the enhanced platinum card benefits salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased for both the three and six month periods reflecting restructuring charges in the prior year and benefits from our cost reduction initiatives in the current year other expenses increased for both the three and six month periods primarily driven by the prior year gain on the sale of the costco hfs portfolio and in the six month period the gain on the sale of the jetblue hfs portfolio also in the prior year the increases were partially offset by lower technology related costs and a benefit in the current year from a change in the liability related to non delivery of goods and services by merchants as well as the hfs valuation allowance adjustment loyalty edge related costs and a contribution to the axp foundation in the prior year income taxes the effective tax rate decreased for both the three and six month periods primarily reflecting the geographic mix of business and the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits in addition the effective tax rates in the current year periods reflected the resolution of certain prior years tax items in the six month period table of contents table 5

business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of june 30 2017 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 16 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face

period as well as growth in card member loans in the current period table of contents cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends the increase in net cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from a higher

legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2016 the 2016 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for example the eu regulation might apply price caps as well as other regulatory measures in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of that part of the regulation as a precursor to the court s final ruling an advisory opinion was issued on july 6 2017 advising the court that a the case should be declared inadmissible and b if the court determines to treat the case as admissible the law should be considered valid and applicable the advisory opinion is not binding on the court and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of our legal challenge for more information on the european union payments legislation our related legal challenge and the australia payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction on july 19 2017 the u k indicated it would ban surcharging on consumer cards starting january 2018 in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups table of contents for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2016 form 10 k consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing and sale of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us internal and regulatory reviews to assess compliance with such laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our card members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties these types of reviews will be a continuing focus for the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as for the company itself as an example federal banking regulators announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are cooperating with regulators in those reviews also in prior years certain cards issued in puerto rico the u s virgin islands and other u s territories largely through our international business did not uniformly carry the same terms conditions and features as the cards we offered to card members in the continental u s we conducted an internal review beginning in 2012 voluntarily provided customer remediation in prior periods and reported this matter to our regulators we have been cooperating with the cfpb s review as to whether this discontinued practice complied with applicable laws and regulations we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results on july 10 2017 the cfpb issued a final rule that among other changes would prohibit providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using a pre dispute arbitration agreement to bar consumers from filing or participating in a class action the rule would apply to agreements entered into on or after march 19 2018 as a result of the rule we may face increased class claims and therefore be subject to the complexities and costs associated with class action litigation given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some class action matters there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of this rule for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction following our appeal of this judgment the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for american express which occurred on january 25 2017 we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see the legal proceedings section in our 2016 form 10 k for descriptions of the doj and related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of

governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment during the quarter we continued to make steady progress on the range of growth and cost initiatives that we have been focused on over the last couple of years and we believe our first quarter performance reflects the benefits of those efforts while reported billed business and revenue declined year over year as a result of the end of the costco wholesale corporation costco relationship in the united states in june 2016 both billed business and revenue performance accelerated in the first quarter in addition our strong balance sheet position allowed us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our worldwide billings adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were flat year over year but grew after excluding costco related billings from the prior year we continued to see strong performance from middle market and small business customers while spending by large corporations was up slightly compared to last year internationally our consumer and small business billings growth rates remained strong revenues net of interest expense declined year over year on a reported basis primarily reflecting costco related revenues in the prior year after excluding costco related revenues and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew driven by increases in adjusted billed business adjusted net interest income as well as higher net card fees across our premium card portfolios our net interest yield increased year over year due in part to a mix shift towards non cobrand lending products where card members tend to revolve more of their loan balances card member loan and receivable growth was strong year over year as we continue to grow loans from existing customers as well as through the acquisition of new card members provisions for losses increased as expected as a result of higher card member loans and receivables as well as a slight increase in delinquencies and higher net write off rates primarily due to the seasoning of loans related to newer card members and a shift towards non cobrand lending products which have a slightly higher write off rate we expect these trends will result in provisions growing faster than loans during the balance of the year spending on card member engagement the aggregate of rewards card member services and marketing and promotion expenses was relatively consistent with the prior year and reflected the recent enhancements to rewards on our u s platinum products continued strong growth in our delta cobrand portfolio higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services and lower marketing and promotion expenses as we seek to utilize different categories of spend to retain and grow our card member spending and earn their loyalty operating expenses decreased versus the prior year driven by our cost reduction initiatives competition remains intense across our businesses while our businesses are global and diversified to remain competitive we need to continue to demonstrate the differentiated value we deliver to merchants customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships more intense competition has and will continue to impact our cost of renewing and ability to win or extend cobrand and other relationships throughout our business we are focused on those products services and relationships that offer the best value to our customers while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in other matters for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco and jetblue airways corporation jetblue collectively the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets on march 18 2016 and june 17 2016 we completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics which do not reflect amounts related to these hfs loans and receivables as credit costs were reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios through the sale completion dates additionally for periods after the sale completion dates activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the hfs portfolios are no longer included in our consolidated results of operations specifically these impacts include discount revenue from costco in the united states for spend on all american express cards and from other merchants for spend on the costco cobrand card other fees and commissions and interest income from costco cobrand card members and card member rewards expense related to the costco cobrand card resulting in a lack of comparability between 2017 and 2016 the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results provide commentary on the variances for the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to same period in the prior year as presented in the accompanying tables table 1 summary of financial performance a earnings per common share diluted was reduced by the impact of i earnings allocated to participating share awards and other items of 10 million and 11 million for the three months ended march 31 2017 and 2016 respectively and ii dividends on preferred shares of 21 million for both the three months ended march 31 2017 and 2016 table 2 total revenue net of interest expense summary table of contents total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue decreased primarily driven by costco related revenue included in the prior year as well as increases in contra discount revenues in the current year including higher corporate client and cobrand partner incentives as volumes in those categories increased worldwide billed business decreased marginally and was flat on an fx adjusted basis 1 u s billed business decreased by 6 percent primarily driven by costco related volumes in the prior year and non u s billed business increased by 12 percent see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance the increase in the average discount rate primarily reflects the absence of costco merchant volumes in the current year which were at a lower discount rate than the average partially offset by rate pressure from merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in the european union and continued growth of the optblue program we expect the average discount rate will likely decline over time due to a greater shift of existing merchants into optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts and certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates net card fees increased primarily driven by growth in the platinum gold and delta portfolios as well as growth in certain international markets including japan and australia other fees and commissions increased primarily driven by an increase in delinquency fees as a result of a change in the date on which late fees are assessed on our u s consumer charge cards partially offset by costco related fees in the prior year other revenues decreased driven in part by prior year revenues related to our loyalty edge business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 interest income decreased primarily driven by costco cobrand related interest income included in the prior year partially offset by modestly higher yields in the current year and an increase in average card member loans across other lending products interest expense increased primarily driven by higher average long term debt and marginally higher interest rates table 3 provisions for losses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates does not reflect the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses increased primarily driven by growth in charge volume in the gcs

compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates table of contents card member loans provision for losses increased primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives as well as a slight increase in delinquencies and higher net write off rates primarily due to the seasoning of loans

financing portfolio credit performance table 4 expenses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the portfolio sale completion dates includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses decreased driven by higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in the prior year card member rewards expenses increased primarily driven by an increase in membership rewards expense of 228 million partially offset by a reduction in cobrand rewards expense of 124 million the increase in membership rewards expense was primarily driven by recent enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards higher spending volumes and an increase in the weighted average cost wac per point the decrease in cobrand rewards expense reflected costco related expenses in the prior year partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products in the current period the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants was 95 percent rounded down at both march 31 2017 and 2016 card member services and other expenses increased driven by higher usage of travel related benefits salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased reflecting benefits from our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring charges in the prior year other expenses decreased reflecting lower technology related costs in the current year and in the prior year loyalty edge related costs and the hfs valuation allowance adjustment partially offset by the gain on the sale of

returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the

markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other various regulatory liquidity requirements such as the lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields table of contents securitized borrowing capacity as of march 31 2017 we maintained our

2017 we had approximately 252 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members

activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for the three months ended march 31 2017 and 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 1 2 billion and 2 5 billion respectively driven by net income of 1 2 billion and 1 4 billion respectively adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the decrease during the periods of comparison was driven primarily by impacts from movements in accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operating activities table of contents cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans including card member loans and receivables hfs along with gains on sales related thereto as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio for the three months ended march 31 2017 and 2016 net cash provided by investing activities was 0 7 billion and 3 7 billion respectively the decrease in the current period as compared to the three months ended march 31 2016

activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the three months ended march 31 2017 and 2016 net cash provided by used in financing activities was 2 2 billion and 3 9 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 primarily resulted from a lower net decrease in short term borrowings and higher net long term debt issuance in the current year as compared to the prior year table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2016 the 2016 form 10 k for further information payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue can be expected to lead card issuers either to look to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards services or benefits to cardholders and other customers or to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges for more information on the european union payments legislation and the australia payments regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network surcharging in certain countries such as certain member states in the european union and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants for example the reserve bank of australia amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread as revisions to the payment services directive in the european union are transposed into national law by each member state there may be increased instances of differential surcharging of our cards customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and card member dissatisfaction in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging are being challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the 2016 form 10 k table of contents consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing and sale of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of u s states have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure laws in certain cases more stringent than u s federal laws u s federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us the review of products and practices to assess compliance with such laws and regulations and to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews for example federal banking regulators have recently announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are cooperating with regulators in those reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our card members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties for more information on cfpb proposed rules as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the 2016 form 10 k antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction following our appeal of this judgment the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for american express which occurred on january 25 2017 we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see the legal proceedings section in our 2016 form 10 k for descriptions of the doj and related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business for more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business please see the risk factors section of the 2016 form 10 k table of contents recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a non gaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans we believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on card member loans asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as asset backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables the loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally

credit information and spend patterns some charge card accounts have additional pay over time features that allow revolving of certain balances table of contents cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained in some cases the partner is liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partner s own loyalty program credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods and rate and fee structures discount revenue

borrowers performing as expected unemployment rates the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written off loans our ability to execute against our lending strategy to grow loans which may be affected by increasing competition brand perceptions and reputation our ability to manage risk in a growing card member loan portfolio and the behavior of card members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products offer attractive non card lending products capture a greater share of existing card members spending and borrowings reduce card member attrition and attract new customers the possibility that we will not execute on our plans to significantly increase merchant coverage which will depend in part on the success of optblue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept american express which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of optblue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for american express acceptance as well as the awareness and willingness of card members to use american express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept american express cards changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies and our results of operations and capital needs in any given period

"2016-12-311","AXP","item 7 management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a executive overview business introduction we are a global services company with four reportable operating segments u s consumer services uscs international consumer and network services icns global commercial services gcs and global merchant services gms the following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services u0095 discount revenue our largest revenue source represents fees generally charged to merchants for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services sold the fees charged or merchant discount which is generally expressed as a percentage of the charge amount varies with among other factors the industry in which the merchant does business the charge amount and the merchant s overall charge volume the method of submission of charges the timing and method of payment to the merchant and in certain instances the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement e g domestic or global in some instances an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for non swiped card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the united states at merchants located in the united states u0095 interest on loans principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances u0095 net card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees which varies based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account u0095 other fees and commissions represent foreign currency conversion fees charged to card members card member delinquency fees loyalty coalition related fees travel commissions and fees service fees and fees related to our membership rewards program and u0095 other revenue represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our global network services gns business including commissions and signing fees net revenue earned on cross border card member spending insurance premiums earned from card member travel and other insurance programs merchant related fees unrelated to merchant discount prepaid card and travelers cheque related revenue revenues related to the american express global business travel joint venture the gbt jv transition services agreement earnings from equity method investments including the gbt jv and other miscellaneous revenue and fees financial highlights u0095 a 1 1 billion 677 million after tax gain on the sale of card member

net charges for costs related to reengineering initiatives and u0095 a 109 million 68 million after tax charge related to the renewal of our partnership with delta air lines delta in the fourth quarter table of contents non gaap measures we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap however certain information included within this report constitutes non gaap financial measures our calculations of non gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies business environment in a challenging economic competitive and regulatory environment we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth optimizing investments and resetting our cost base in 2016 revenue was lower year over year though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter we made a record level of business building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove 1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017 in addition we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our worldwide billings for 2016 adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were up slightly year over year our u s consumer billings were down resulting from the end of the costco relationship in the united states in june 2016 we saw strong performance from middle market and small businesses in the united states while spending by large corporations declined year over year internationally our consumer and small business billings growth rates remained strong revenues net of interest expense for the year declined versus the prior year primarily reflecting higher costco related revenues in the prior year after excluding costco related revenues and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew driven by increases in adjusted billed business adjusted net interest income and net card fees across our premium card portfolios card member loan growth was strong year over year and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of our customers borrowings provisions for losses were up modestly versus the prior year but grew more significantly after excluding from the prior year credit costs associated with the costco and jetblue card member loan portfolios the growth in provisions for losses was driven by both higher card member loans and a slight increase in delinquency and net write off rates due to the seasoning of loans related to newer card members we expect that some modest gradual upward pressure on our delinquency and write off rates due primarily to this seasoning of loans related to newer card members will cause provisions to grow faster than loans in 2017 total expenses for the year declined versus the prior year driven by the gains on the sales of the costco and jetblue portfolios which were recognized as a reduction in other expenses as well as a decline in rewards expense driven by higher costco cobrand rewards expenses included in the prior year and the shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra discount revenue marketing and promotion expenses grew significantly due to higher levels of spending on growth initiatives card member services and other expenses also increased driven by higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services such as airport lounge access and certain cobrand card benefits we anticipate spending less on marketing and promotion in 2017 rewards expense and card member services and other expenses after excluding costco cobrand related costs should continue to grow in 2017 due to higher billings and enhancements to our card product value propositions competition remains intense across our businesses while our businesses are global and diversified to remain competitive we need to continue to demonstrate the differentiated value we deliver to merchants customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships more intense competition has and will continue to impact our cost of renewing and ability to win or extend cobrand and other relationships throughout our business we are focused on those products services and relationships that offer the best value to our customers while also providing appropriate returns to our business and shareholders for discussion of certain legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition see supervision and regulation in business table of contents consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section effective june 30 2014 as a result of the gbt jv transaction we deconsolidated the global business travel net assets and now offer business travel related services through the non consolidated joint venture resulting in a lack of comparability between 2015 and 2014 effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets on march 18 2016 and june 17 2016 we completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets were to provisions for losses and credit metrics which do not reflect amounts related to these hfs loans and receivables as credit costs were reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios through the sale completion dates additionally for periods after the sale completion dates activities associated with these cobrand partnerships and the hfs portfolios are no longer included in our consolidated results of operations specifically these impacts include discount revenue from costco in the united states for spend on all american express cards and from other merchants for spend on the costco cobrand card other fees and commissions and interest income from costco cobrand card members and card member rewards expense related to the costco cobrand card resulting in a lack of comparability between 2016 and 2015 the relationship of the u s dollar to various foreign currencies over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations where meaningful in describing our performance foreign currency adjusted amounts which exclude the impact of changes in the foreign exchange fx rates have been provided table 1 summary of financial performance table 2 total revenues net of interest expense summary a travel commissions and fees which were previously disclosed separately on the consolidated statements of income are now included within other fees and commissions total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue decreased 617 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower costco related revenue both periods of comparison reflected increases in contra discount revenues including cash rebate rewards which in 2015 as compared to 2014 was offset by growth in billed business table of contents overall billed business was flat in 2016 compared to 2015 u s billed business decreased 3 percent primarily driven by lower costco related volumes and non u s billed business increased 6 percent 10 percent on an fx adjusted basis 1 the average discount rate was 2 45 percent 2 46 percent and 2 48 percent for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in the average discount rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven primarily by growth of the optblue program merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in the european union and a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals partially offset by the benefit to the discount rate from the decline in costco merchant volumes in the current year we expect the average discount rate will likely continue to decline over time due to further expansion of optblue merchant negotiations and competition volume related pricing discounts and certain pricing initiatives mainly driven by pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate net card fees increased 186 million or 7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 increasing 5 percent on an fx adjusted basis 1 the increase in 2016 was driven primarily by growth in the platinum gold and delta portfolios other fees and commissions decreased 113 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and 760 million or 21 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower costco related fees partially offset by an increase in delinquency and loyalty coalition related fees the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the gbt jv transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods other revenues were relatively flat in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased 956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the current year included a contractual payment from a gns partner and higher revenues from our prepaid services business offset by lower revenues related to costco loyalty edge which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the gbt jv transition services agreement the decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by gains related to the sales of investment securities in concur and industrial and commercial bank of china in 2014 interest income decreased 70 million or 1 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower costco cobrand loans and the associated interest income partially offset by modestly higher yields and an increase in average card member loans across other lending products the increase in 2015 primarily reflects higher average card member loans partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities interest expense increased 81 million or 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased 84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances partially offset by lower average long term debt the decrease in 2015 was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits partially offset by an increase in average customer deposit balances table 3 provisions for losses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates does not reflect the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses decreased 41 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and 55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was driven by lower net write offs and improved delinquencies the decrease in 2015 reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014 partially offset by higher write offs card member loans provision for losses increased 45 million or 4 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and 52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by strong momentum in our lending growth initiatives resulting in higher loan balances increased net write offs in the current year and a slight increase in delinquencies partially offset by the impact of the hfs portfolios as the current year does not reflect the associated credit costs as previously mentioned the increase in 2015 primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014 the reserve build in 2015 was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances partially offset by lower write offs and the impact related to transferring the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs in december 2015 1 the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u s dollars i e assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding period against which such results are being compared fx adjusted revenues and expenses constitute non gaap measures we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates table of contents other provision for losses increased 34 million or 56 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased 53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by growth in the commercial financing portfolio resulting in higher net write offs the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a merchant related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 table 4 expenses summary a beginning december 1 2015 through to the sale completion dates includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses increased 541 million or 17 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased 107 million or 3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 increasing 1 percent on an fx adjusted basis with higher levels of spending on growth initiatives in both periods 2 card member rewards expenses decreased 203 million or 3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by lower cobrand rewards expense of 518 million primarily reflecting lower costco related expenses and a shift in volumes to cash rebate cards for which the rewards costs are classified as contra discount revenue partially offset by increased spending volumes across other cobrand card products the lower cobrand rewards expense was partially offset by higher membership rewards expense of 315 million primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes recent enhancements to u s consumer and small business platinum rewards and less of a decline in the weighted average cost wac per point the increase in 2015 was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of 199 million driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of 134 million the latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the ultimate redemption rate urr and a decline in the wac per point assumption including the impact of the 109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the delta partnership renewal partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned driven by higher spending volumes card member services and other expenses increased 115 million or 11 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and 196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by increased usage of travel related benefits the increase in 2015 was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements salaries and employee benefits expenses increased 283 million or 6 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased 1 1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher restructuring charges in the current year the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods other expenses decreased 1 6 billion or 24 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of the hfs portfolios in the current year as well as goodwill and technology impairment charges in the prior year the increase in 2015 reflects the net gain from the gbt jv transaction in 2014 and the goodwill and technology impairment charges in 2015 partially offset by the reassessment of the functional currency of certain uk legal entities other fx related activity and a litigation reserve release in 2015 2 refer to footnote 1 on page 39 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information

across other lending products total revenues net of interest expense increased 623 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by higher discount revenue as a result of 5 percent

enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel

will be fully phased in by january 1 2019 see section on fully phased in basel iii we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced

ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be required to use the lower of the regulatory risk based capital ratios based on the standardized or advanced approaches to

regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into

are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents

dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the year ended december 31 2016 we returned 5 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends 1 1 billion and share repurchases 4 4 billion we repurchased 70 million common shares at an average price of 63 11 in 2016 these dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 99 percent of total capital generated during the year table of contents in addition during the year ended december 31 2016 we had 750 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred shares the series b preferred shares and 850 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred shares the series c preferred shares outstanding dividends declared and paid on series b and series c preferred shares during 2016 were 39 million and 41 million respectively for additional information on our preferred shares refer to note 17 common and preferred shares and note 22 earnings per common share eps preferred shares to the consolidated financial statements funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes including acquisition activities funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a long term committed bank borrowing facility we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december 31 table 21 summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time our funding plan for the full year 2017 includes among other sources approximately 7 billion to 15 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately 5 billion to 12 billion of secured term debt issuance our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody s investor services moody s standard poor s s p fitch ratings fitch and dominion bond rating services dbrs such ratings help support our access to cost effective

borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs short term funding programs short term borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interest bearing overdrafts with banks our short term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of short term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december 31 2016 we had 3 0 billion in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of 0 5 billion in commercial paper outstanding during 2016 refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our centurion bank and american express bank subsidiaries these funds are currently insured up to 250 000 per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the capital levels of centurion bank and american express bank we through american express bank have a direct retail deposit program personal savings from american express to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third party distribution channels the direct retail program makes fdic insured certificates of deposit cds and high yield savings account products available directly to consumers as of december 31 2016 we had 53 0 billion in customer deposits refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits long term debt programs as of december 31 2016 we had 47 0 billion in long term debt outstanding during 2016 we and our subsidiaries issued 3 8 billion of unsecured debt with maturities

corporation fixed rate senior notes weighted average coupon of 1 65 3 5 floating rate senior notes 3 month libor plus 57 basis points on average 0 3 total 3 8 asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the loans and receivables being securitized are reported as card member loans and receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of debt securities during the twelve months ended december 31 2016 no such triggering events occurred liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus table of contents includes a number of elements including but not limited to u0095 maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details u0095 maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources u0095 projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios u0095 establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements or u0095 incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on balance sheet and off balance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and asset securitization conduit facilities through our u s bank subsidiaries centurion bank and american express bank we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market wide firm specific and combined liquidity stresses the lcr rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high quality liquid assets we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements we were in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which we were subject including the lcr for the year ended december 31 2016 the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december 31 2016 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 16 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 17 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december 31 2016 3 0 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility which was subsequently reduced to 0 7 billion on january 17 2017 no amounts were drawn on the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions centurion bank and american express bank may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 57 0 billion as of december 31 2016 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december 31 2016 of 3 0 billion which expires on december 9 2018 the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with each of our table of contents covenants as of december 31 2016 no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility the capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows

net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for december 31 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 8 2 billion and 10 6 billion respectively driven by net income of 5 4 billion and 5 2

includes gains of 1 2 billion on the sales of the hfs portfolios which is presented in net decrease increase in card member receivables and loans including held for sale within cash flows from investing activities the decrease during the periods of comparison was also driven primarily by impacts from movements in other assets as a result of normal business operating activities cash flows

customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 7 5 billion and 1 7 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily resulted from a net decrease in customer deposits and short term borrowings partially offset by lower net repayments of long term debt in the current year as compared to the prior year table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on and off balance sheet transactions arrangements obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the table below identifies transactions that represent our contractually committed future obligations purchase obligations include our agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction table 25 committed future obligations by year a the table above excludes approximately 1 0 billion of tax liabilities related to the uncertainty in income taxes as inherent complexities and the number of tax years currently open for examination in multiple jurisdictions do not permit reasonable estimates of payments if any to be made over a range of years refer to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information b estimated interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate in place as of december 31 2016 and includes the effect of existing interest rate swaps actual cash flows may differ from estimated payments c as of december 31 2016 there were no minimum required contributions and no contributions are currently planned for the u s american express retirement plan for the u s american express retirement restoration plan and non u s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in 2017 are anticipated to be approximately 34 million and this amount has been included within other long term liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating 666 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other long term liabilities do not include 7 1 billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered long term liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable d as of december 31 2016 we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a 266 million unfunded commitment included in other long term liabilities in addition to this amount there was a further 151 million of contractual off balance sheet obligations which have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information e the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non cancelable minimum contractual obligations as applicable by period under contracts that were in effect as of december 31 2016 f represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained such cobrand agreements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to eight years we expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table 25 we have off balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our principal guarantees are associated with card member services to enhance the value of owning an american express card as of december 31 2016 we had guarantees totaling approximately 48 billion related to card member protection plans as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 242 billion of unused credit outstanding as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members to mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives we accepted non cash collateral in the form of security interests in u s treasury securities from our derivatives counterparties with a fair value of 18 million and nil as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively none of which was sold or repledged refer to notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other off balance sheet arrangements table of contents risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the general auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes controls talent and capabilities the board monitors the tone at the top our risk culture and oversees emerging and strategic risks the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight of our enterprise wide risk management framework processes and methodologies the risk committee approves our erm policy the erm policy governs risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite for risks including individual credit risk institutional credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk reputational risk compliance risk model risk asset liability risk and strategic and business risk risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance including stressed forward looking scenarios in addition it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits escalation triggers and assessing control programs the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks transactions and exposures the risk committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the risk appetite framework including significant risk exposures risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards our internal capital adequacy assessment process including its comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar submissions and resolution planning the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors reviews and approves compliance policies which include our compliance risk tolerance statement in addition the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporate wide compliance risk management program more broadly this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process internal and external auditing including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls the audit and compliance

approves internal audit s annual audit plan charter policies and budget the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan s status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs as well as those covering our business units and risk taking employees appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals including for our business units our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forward looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks the compensation and benefits committee uses a risk balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives there are several internal management committees including the enterprise wide risk management committee ermc chaired by our chief risk officer the ermc is the highest level management committee to oversee all firm wide risks and is responsible for risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite it maintains the enterprise wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies company wide the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters economic capital and basel capital trends and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking business unit presidents our chief credit officer chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions table of contents overseeing risk taking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief operational risk officer the corporate controller and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing market liquidity asset liability risk and capital credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards lines of credit and loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections externally the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth which can affect customer liquidity the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy this policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension including prospecting new account approvals point of sale authorizations credit line management and collections the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision making models that use the most up to date information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus additional data such as commercial variables are integrated to further mitigate small business risk we have developed data driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our global commercial services global merchant services gns prepaid services and foreign exchange services businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by client specific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk adjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see risk factors table of contents debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december 31 2016 we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre implementation test metrics and d process and entity level risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers and or us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information security privacy and data governance we have implemented an information security program and operating model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction our information security program and operating model are based on the national institute of standards and technology nist cybersecurity framework and cover different phases of security to identify protect detect respond and recover from information security incidents chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program in addition the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness the information security oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure chaired by the global head of privacy and information security oversight and attended by the chief privacy officer our privacy risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our privacy program the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection notice use sharing transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities see a significant operating disruption a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards under risk factors for additional information compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non compliance with applicable laws regulations rules or standards of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate wide compliance risk management table of contents program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed we have a comprehensive anti money laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the anti money laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products services business practices management clients and partners whether perceived or real could cause a decline in the customer base costly litigation or revenue reductions we view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long term success our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc and its sub committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include u0095 interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and our interest rates on our liabilities such as debt and deposits and u0095 foreign exchange risk related to transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the u s dollar our asset liability management alm and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the risk committee of the board of directors market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and alm activities as well as overseeing compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we generally do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payments business activities refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments as of december 31 2016 a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately 193 million this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from a rate increase is then measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve month horizon reprice by 100 basis points actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors for example the interest rate we pay on deposit balances within our high yield savings accounts may not change at the same time or to the same degree as market interest rates in addition to parallel rate changes our net interest income is subject to changes in the relationship between market benchmark rates for example movements in prime rate change the yield on a large portion of our variable rate u s lending receivables and loans while libor rates determine the effective interest rate on a significant portion of our outstanding funding differences in the rate of change of these two benchmark indices commonly referred to as basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one month libor over the next twelve months is estimated to be 35 million we currently have approximately 36 billion of prime based variable rate u s lending receivables and loans and 35 billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations table of contents foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways 1 card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency 2 cross currency transactions and balances from our funding activities 3 cross currency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and 4 revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december 31 2016 and 2015 foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately 28 billion and 26 billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december 31 2016 with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december 31 2016 with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next twelve months would be approximately 185 million as of december 31 2016 to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve month period even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees table of contents critical accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date in estimating these losses we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve the models take into account several factors including delinquency based loss migration rates loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period as well as expected future recoveries we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member loans and receivables the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends is not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter as of december 31 2016 a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately 169 million this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency based loss migration rates or recoveries or the amount of outstanding balances may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses liability for membership rewards expense the membership rewards program is our largest card based rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel entertainment retail certificates and merchandise points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing promotion rewards and card member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december 31 2016 an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 92 million similarly an increase in the wac per point of 1 basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 89 million table of contents fair value measurement our investment securities and derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets which require management to make assumptions and apply judgments when assessing fair value the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability by utilizing the three level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value when available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value level 1 if quoted market prices are not available we will measure fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs level 2 we do not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level 3 for additional information on our fair value hierarchy refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements investment securities our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed income securities issued by states and municipalities in the united states the u s government and its agencies and select foreign governments the fair value of our investment securities including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets are obtained primarily from third party pricing services the fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services used as of december 31 2016 and 2015 for additional information on our investment securities refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements the fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models or by internal pricing models where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets for additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in the measurement of fair value for our investment securities and derivative instruments although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are based on observable markets inputs the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs or how they are modeled could result in a different estimate of fair value we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our third party valuation services at least annually goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal multi year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples e g earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the prepaid services goodwill impairment in 2015 we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions table of contents income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties table of contents other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a non gaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans we believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it is a component of net interest yield on card member loans asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as asset backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying loans or receivables the loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards it represents the percentage of billed business generated from both proprietary and gns card member spending retained by us from merchants we acquire or for merchants acquired by a third party on our behalf net of amounts retained by such third party basic cards in force proprietary basic consumer cards in

activity within retail cobrand portfolios in gns from which we earn no revenue is not included in non proprietary billed business card billed business is included in the united states or outside the united states based on where the issuer is located capital ratios represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on and off balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates refer to the capital strategy section under consolidated capital resources and liquidity for further related definitions under transitional basel iii and fully phased in basel iii card member the individual holder of an issued american express branded charge credit and certain prepaid cards card member loans represents the outstanding amount due from card members for charges made on their american express credit cards as well as any interest charges and card related fees card member loans also include revolving balances on certain american express charge card products card member loans and receivables hfs beginning as of december 1 2015 and continuing until the sales were completed

17 2016 respectively card member receivables represents the outstanding amount due from card members for charges made on their american express charge cards as well as any card related fees charge cards represents cards that generally carry no pre set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month no finance charges are assessed on charge cards each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a card member s most recent credit information and spend patterns some charge card accounts have additional pay over time features that allow revolving of certain balances cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial firms pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained in some cases the partner is liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partner s own loyalty program credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods and rate and fee structures table of contents discount revenue represents revenue earned from fees generally charged to merchants who have entered into a card acceptance agreement the discount fee generally is deducted from our payment for card member purchases discount revenue is reduced by incentive payments made to merchants payments to third party card issuing partners cash back reward costs and statement credits corporate incentive payments and other similar items interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans and receivables general corporate purposes and liquidity needs and is recognized as incurred interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii debt which primarily relates to interest expense on our long term financing and short term borrowings e g commercial paper federal funds purchased bank overdrafts and other short term borrowings as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long term debt interest income includes i interest on loans ii interest and dividends on investment securities and iii interest income on deposits with banks and other interest on loans assessed using the average daily balance method for card member loans and loans hfs unless the loan is classified as non accrual interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixed income securities interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts fees and other payments so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled interest income on deposits with banks and other recognized as earned and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near term funding requirements in interest bearing time deposits overnight sweep accounts and other interest bearing demand and call accounts liquidity coverage ratio represents the minimum standards established by the regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient liquidity to meet liquidity needs in periods of financial and economic stress merchant acquisition represents our process of entering into agreements with merchants to accept american express branded cards net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs net interest yield on card member loans a non gaap measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average loans computed on an annualized basis reserves and net write offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation we believe net interest yield on card member loans is useful to investors because it provides a measure of profitability of our card member loan portfolio net loss ratio represents the ratio of gcp charge card write offs consisting of principal resulting from authorized transactions and fee components less recoveries on card member receivables expressed as a percentage of gross amounts billed to corporate card members net write off rate principal only represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business card member loans or receivables written off consisting of principal resulting from authorized transactions less recoveries as a

of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 which are subject to risks and uncertainties the forward looking statements which address our expected business and financial performance among other matters contain words such as believe expect estimate anticipate intend plan aim will may should could would likely and similar expressions readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following u0095 our ability to grow in the future which will depend in part on the following revenues growing consistently with current expectations which could be impacted by among other things weakening economic conditions in the united states or internationally a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of card members to sustain and grow spending a further strengthening of the u s dollar a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected a greater impact on discount revenue from cash back and cobrand partner and client incentive payments more cautious spending by large and global corporate card members lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated and our inability to capitalize on investment momentum capabilities and efficiencies as we moderate marketing and promotion spend our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives including growing profitable spending from new and existing card members increasing penetration among middle market and small business clients expanding our international footprint and increasing merchant acceptance the level of spend in bonus categories on rewards based and or cash back cards and redemptions of card member rewards and offers the impact of any future restructuring charges or other contingencies including but not limited to litigation related settlements judgments or expenses impairments the imposition of fines or civil money penalties an increase in card member reimbursements and changes in reserves write downs of deferred tax assets as a result of tax law or other changes credit performance remaining consistent with current expectations continued growth of card member loans the ability to continue to realize benefits from restructuring actions and operating leverage at levels consistent with current expectations the amount we spend on growth initiatives and our ability to drive growth from such investments changes in interest rates beyond current expectations including the impact of hedge ineffectiveness the impact of regulation and litigation which could affect the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities require changes to business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and card members our tax rate remaining in line with current expectations which could be impacted by among other things our geographic mix of income being weighted more to higher tax jurisdictions than expected changes in tax laws and regulation and unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program u0095 changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards competition for cobrand relationships and the success of marketing promotion or rewards programs u0095 the actual amount to be spent on marketing and promotion as well as the timing of any such spending which will be based in part on management s assessment of competitive opportunities overall business performance contractual obligations with business partners and other fixed costs and prior commitments management s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments which could be impacted by business regulatory or legal complexities and our ability to realize efficiencies optimize investment spending and control expenses to fund such spending u0095 rewards expense and cost of card member services growing faster or slower than expectations which will depend in part on card member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns and actual usage and redemption of rewards as well as the degree of interest of card members in the value proposition we offer increasing competition which could result in greater rewards offerings our ability to enhance card products and services to make them attractive to card members and the amount we spend on the promotion of enhanced services and rewards categories and the success of such promotion u0095 our ability to reduce our overall cost base which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of reengineering plans which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings and underestimating hiring and other employee needs our ability to reduce annual operating expenses which could be impacted by among other things the factors identified below and our ability to optimize and lower marketing and promotion expenses which could be impacted by higher advertising and card member acquisition costs competitive pressures that may require additional expenditures or limit our ability to reduce costs an inability to shift acquisition to digital channels the availability of opportunities to invest at a higher level due to favorable business results and changes in macroeconomic conditions u0095 the ability to reduce annual operating expenses which could be impacted by the need to increase significant categories of operating expenses such as consulting or professional fees including as a result of increased litigation compliance or regulatory related costs or fraud costs our ability to develop implement and achieve substantial benefits from reengineering plans higher than expected employee levels the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs the payment of civil money penalties disgorgement restitution non income tax assessments and litigation related settlements impairments of goodwill or other assets management s decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology business and product development and sales forces depending on overall business performance greater than expected inflation or merit increases our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications and the level of m a activity and related expenses table of contents u0095 our lending delinquency and write off rates and growth of provision expense being higher than current expectations which will depend in part on changes in the level of loan balances delinquency rates mix of loan balances loans related to new card members and other borrowers performing as expected unemployment rates the volume of bankruptcies and recoveries of previously written off loans u0095 our ability to execute against our lending strategy to grow loans which may be affected by increasing competition brand perceptions and reputation our ability to manage risk in a growing card member loan portfolio and the behavior of card members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns which in turn may be driven by our ability to issue new and enhanced card products offer attractive non card lending products capture a greater share of existing card members spending and borrowings reduce card member attrition and attract new customers u0095 the possibility that we will not fully execute on our plans for optblue to significantly increase merchant coverage which will depend in part on the success of optblue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept american express which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of optblue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for american express acceptance as well as the awareness and willingness of card members to use american express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept american express cards u0095 changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators the amount we spend on acquisitions of companies and our results of operations and capital needs in any given period u0095 changes in global economic and business conditions consumer and business spending the availability and cost of capital unemployment rates geopolitical conditions including potential impacts resulting from the u s administration and the proposed exit of the united kingdom from the european union foreign currency rates and interest rates all of which may significantly affect demand for and spending on american express cards delinquency rates loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations u0095 changes in capital and credit market conditions including sovereign creditworthiness which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios access to capital and cost of capital including changes in interest rates changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts u0095 legal and regulatory developments including with regard to actions by the cfpb and other regulators broad payment system regulatory regimes and the stricter regulation of financial institutions which could require us to make fundamental changes to many of our business practices result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight litigation related settlements judgments or expenses restitution to card members or the imposition of fines or civil money penalties materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock result in harm to the american express brand potential actions by the fdic and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts which could impact our asset securitization program or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses the allowance of deductions for significant expenses or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions products and services u0095 changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners such as bankruptcies restructurings or consolidations including merchants that represent a significant portion of our business such as the airline industry or our partners in gns or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations and u0095 factors beyond our control such as fire power loss disruptions in telecommunications severe weather conditions natural disasters health pandemics terrorism cyberattacks or fraud which could significantly affect demand for and spending on american express cards delinquency rates loan balances and results of operations or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions a further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in risk factors above and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission table of contents","item 1a risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10 k based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities strategic business and competitive risks difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the united states and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the united states and abroad uneven global economic growth has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products a prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately 25 percent of our u s billed business during 2016 for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and also tend to decline during general economic downturns geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business further economic or political instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and business spending including in other parts of the world factors such as consumer spending business investment government spending interest rates tax rates fuel and other energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment lower family income lower consumer spending lower demand for credit lower corporate earnings or lower business investment is likely to materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore such factors may cause our earnings credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares table of contents our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers paper based transactions e g cash and checks bank transfer models e g wire transfers and ach as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most countries as a result card issuers and acquirers on the visa and mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have including larger cash reserves may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors we expect expenses such as card member rewards and card member services expenses to continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for card members including in response to increased competition spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of payment systems based on ach or other payment mechanisms to the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed loop network could be negatively impacted if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers and or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions in addition companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices through digital wallets mobile applications or at the point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress use of our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets and applications impacting our profitability on transactions laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes more restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure see ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products we face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries for example we have partnered with delta air lines as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including the airline industry to offer benefits to card member participants competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically have high spending loyal customers our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2016 card member loans related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 34 percent of our worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2016 table of contents cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to eight years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships in addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in a significant decline in our card member loans outstanding for example our u s cobrand relationship with costco ended in 2016 and we sold the outstanding card member loans associated with the costco portfolio in 2016 starwood hotels resorts worldwide with which we have a cobrand partnership was acquired by marriott international which has a cobrand partnership with a competing card issuer we also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships continues to increase we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the united states and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks we may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationships the loss of business partners whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with costco in the united states in 2016 or early termination as the result of a merger or otherwise such as the withdrawal of american airlines in 2014 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source in recent years we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure including as a result of regulatory mandated reductions to competitors pricing to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives we also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower expense bases that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives and or concessions we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives we further expect some erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we seek to increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants in addition differentiated payment models and technologies from non traditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietary branded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volumes a continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results if the average merchant discount rate declines more than expected we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volumes increasing other sources of revenue such as fee based revenue or interest income or both we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added services for merchants and card members table of contents surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge card purchases the number of countries in the eu that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of american express cards could increase following adoption of new eu wide regulation as discussed in supervision and regulation payments regulation in australia we have seen merchant surcharging on american express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard cards a practice that is known as differential surcharging we also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards our card members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our card members expectations and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements if surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread american express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cards in force and transaction volumes the impact could vary depending on such factors as the manner in which a surcharge is levied how card members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other payment cards including whether it varies depending on the type of card network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our card members if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics customer interactions and communications alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services the process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for industry wide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card members or merchants or the complexity of our systems we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing card lending balances we have been spending at elevated levels on a number of growth initiatives over the past several years including to attract new card members reduce card member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings there can be no assurance that our investments to acquire card members and increase usage of our cards will be effective for example we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced cards or customers may not accept our new products and services which would negatively impact our results of operations increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer another way we invest in customer value is through our membership rewards program as well as other card member benefits any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of membership rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours table of contents we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and card member services expenses in the future if such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as fee based revenues or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and its attributes are key assets of ours and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices merchant acceptance financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card members and corporate clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new card members and customers and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of a third party vendor merchant acquirer or gns partner may be attributed by card members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability a significant operating disruption a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards we and other third parties process transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation denial of service and security attacks for example we and other u s financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy or manipulate various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including card member and loyalty program account information employee information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity financial results and intellectual property there are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites as outsourcing specialization of functions and technology innovation within the payments industry increase more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards and there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by third parties or to which they have access including merchants that accept our cards and our business partners may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident table of contents we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts the possibility of information security incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely risks associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or negative impact to online accounts and systems these risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed for example with the increased use of emv technology we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempts our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or similar events service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed countries could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those countries if our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our cards or customer online accounts were to rise due to an information security incident at a business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response costs greater concerns of customers and or business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and have a material adverse impact on our business if such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded information security incidents and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or data protection including leaked business data may also disrupt our operations undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies successful cyberattacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions large retailers or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries including the airline industry that represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with these industries including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations and alliances of our partners and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners and merchants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as i our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured debt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade by s p and moody s ii our ceasing to have a public debt rating or iii a shortfall in certain performance levels if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations for example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards the airline industry which represents a significant portion of our billed business has undergone bankruptcies restructurings consolidations and other similar events in the past the airline industry accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2016 our largest airline cobrand portfolio american express delta skymiles accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2016 and approximately 20 percent of worldwide card member loans as of december 31 2016 we have credit risk to the airline industry to the extent we protect card members against non delivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a card member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member table of contents for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline industry under md a we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted we have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies businesses or technologies into our existing operations could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally joint ventures including our gbt jv and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand we rely on third party providers of various computer systems platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business we rely on third party service providers merchants processors aggregators gns partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations including the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network if a service provider or other third party fails to provide the data quality communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or other cybersecurity incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers we are subject to the risk that activities of our third party service providers may adversely affect our business a failure to exercise adequate oversight over third party service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third party networks or platforms could become compromised which could significantly harm our business even if the attack or breach does not impact our systems in addition the management of multiple third party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics intrusion into or degradation of our infrastructure by hackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business because of our proximity to the world trade center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our information technology systems because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel related spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and health related risks in addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies that we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travel related spending if the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations card member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events the impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations table of contents the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our business in the united kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as brexit including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the united kingdom and other countries and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate we may experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro further strengthening the u s dollar which could continue to adversely impact our results of operations from our international activities the exit itself could also have a negative impact on the united kingdom and other european economies which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us as of december 31 2016 the emea region constituted approximately 10 percent of our worldwide billed business it is unclear at this stage the financial trade and legal implications of brexit for example we may no longer be able to provide payment services from the united kingdom to eu member states which may require changes to the structure of our business operations in europe our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel as further described in supervision and regulation compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of our u s bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the fdic and the occ this regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business legal regulatory and compliance risks ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the u s antitrust laws visa and mastercard which were also defendants in the doj and state action entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement which was approved by the court the settlement enjoins visa and mastercard from entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale following a non jury trial in the doj case the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and on april 30 2015 the court issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction following our appeal of this judgment on september 26 2016 the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for american express which occurred on january 25 2017 the doj and states may seek further review of this ruling we are also a defendant in a number of actions and arbitration proceedings including proposed class actions filed by merchants that challenge the non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages a description of these legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings an adverse outcome in these proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation and or arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in visa s and mastercard s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and has the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses increase our costs of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or make our products and services more expensive for customers regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders table of contents the current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased and unpredictable regulatory investigations and enforcement is likely to continue to result in changes to our business practices products and procedures and potentially additional penalties and or restitution payments to card members in addition new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and card members or affect retention of our key personnel such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain activities or acquisitions additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital in recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for example gns arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to non discrimination and honor all cards we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of price caps as well as other regulatory measures in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent there can be no assurance that our legal challenge will be successful for a description of certain regulations and their impact on us see supervision and regulation payments regulation legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml programs similar aml requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation and or a material adverse effect on our business businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future the cfpb issued a proposed rule that if enacted would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed as a result claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities and costs associated with class action cases the continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters table of contents we have been subject to regulatory actions by the cfpb and other regulators and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non public supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements including those imposed by the capital rules the lcr the nsfr or by regulators in implementing other portions of the basel iii framework and the enhanced supervision requirements of dodd frank could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital and liquidity regime that will apply to us and our u s bank subsidiaries as a result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity the capital requirements applicable to the company as a bank holding company and our u s bank subsidiaries have been substantially revised to implement the international basel iii framework and are in the process of being phased in these requirements particularly once they are fully phased in require the company and our u s bank subsidiaries to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past as part of our required stress testing both internally and by the federal reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rules as they are phased in compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules including the capital rules and the lcr requires a material investment of resources an inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the company and our u s bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approaches implementation depending on how the advanced approaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach in such a case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio there are several recent proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as the company and our u s bank subsidiaries as well as our ability to meet these requirements the basel committee has adopted a framework that would impose a capital buffer on certain banks that may have an important impact on their domestic economies so called domestic systemically important banks or d sibs the u s banking regulators have not designated any d sibs in the united states additionally the basel committee has proposed a series of revisions to the standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirements if these or other proposals are adopted in the united states and applied to advanced approaches institutions or if we are designated as a d sib we could be required to hold significantly more capital for more information on capital adequacy requirements see capital leverage and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the federal reserve for review as part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our

requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted table of contents in addition the capital rules include a capital conservation buffer which is being phased in from january 1 2016 through january 1 2019 the capital rules also include a countercyclical capital buffer which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the federal reserve in the future these buffers can be satisfied only with cet1 capital if our risk based capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would face graduated constraints on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions based on the amount of the shortfall a failure to increase dividends along with our competitors or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share

laws including data localization laws are interpreted and applied compliance costs may increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place in recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information security in the united states and in various countries in which we operate in addition state and federal legislators and or regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information security related practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer and or employee information and some of our current or planned business activities new legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives moreover the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws relating to consumer and or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed loop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect

litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand we may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment e g natural disasters operational risk includes among others the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third party s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to data in our systems we grant to third party service providers as processes are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational and compliance risks can expose us to reputational risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations table of contents if we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary

technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation a future assertion of an infringement claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant monetary damages tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value added taxes vat to certain transactions while we believe we comply with all applicable vat and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities in addition unilateral or multi jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity to address base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities changes in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business we are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions even if we do not change the way in which we transact a change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results for more information on recently issued accounting standards see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements

risk operational risk compliance risk model risk strategic and business risk and reputational risk see risk management under md a for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective there may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and or forecasting models although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused if our decisions are based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we may face adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation in addition some decisions our regulators make including those related to our capital distribution plans may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient table of contents we may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member receivables and loans and institutional credit risk from merchants gns partners gcs clients loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons country regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses we expect that some modest gradual upward pressure on our write off rates will cause provisions to grow faster than loans in 2017 higher write off rates and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud in addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the united states where approximately 75 percent of our revenues are generated changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital we need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from card members cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and long term notes and asset securitizations and direct and third party sourced deposits securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities a committed bank borrowing facility and the federal reserve discount window our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business in some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see consolidated capital resources and liquidity funding programs and activities under md a any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries long term and short term debt are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital during 2016 approximately 25 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the united states we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the u s dollar which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 foreign currency movements relative to the u s dollar negatively impacted our net revenues of 32 1 billion by approximately 0 4 billion as the u s dollar strengthened against many currencies table of contents foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into u s dollars or our ability to transfer them political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local card members spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by card members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency substantial and sudden devaluation of local card members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country the occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations continuing concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely if there is a significant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro the value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into u s dollars for inclusion in our financial statements similarly the reintroduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities the reintroduction of individual country currencies would require us to reconfigure our billing and other systems to reflect individual country currencies in place of the euro implementing such changes could be costly and failures in the currency reconfiguration could cause disruptions in our normal business operations in addition foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge our market exposure to re introduced currencies may not be immediately available or may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us the potential developments regarding europe and the euro or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could continue to have an adverse impact on consumer and business behavior in europe and globally which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net income could fall our interest expense was approximately 1 7 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 193 million as of december 31 2016 in addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances card members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations for a further discussion of our interest rate risk see risk management market risk management process under md a the value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition we held approximately 3 2 billion of investment securities as of december 31 2016 in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business our u s bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third party brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through american express personal savings and use the proceeds as a source of funding as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 52 3 billion in total u s retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through third party brokerage networks we face strong competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost effective deposit balances if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our u s bank subsidiaries the fdia s brokered deposit provisions and related fdic rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid see prompt corrective action under supervision and regulation for additional information table of contents while centurion bank and american express bank were considered well capitalized as of december 31 2016 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition the capital rules particularly when fully phased in require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity additionally our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses including the interest rates we pay on deposits an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business ","item 3 legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims investigations examinations information gathering requests subpoenas inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings we do not believe we are a party to nor are any of our properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of the doj or

governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment during the third quarter we remained focused on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth optimize our investments and reset our cost base our results reflected progress on our cost reduction efforts and steady credit performance partially offset by a higher level of investment spending and a restructuring charge reported billed business loans and revenues declined year over year primarily due to the end of our relationship with costco wholesale corporation in the united states costco and the sales of the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco and jetblue airways corporation jetblue collectively the hfs portfolios however we saw underlying growth in billed business loans and revenues on an adjusted basis as described further below in addition our strong capital position allowed us to return capital to shareholders for the third quarter worldwide billings adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates were down year over year but were up after excluding costco related billings from the prior year billings in the quarter were also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices which remained headwinds across our u s businesses we continued to see differing trends between spending by large corporations which declined year over year and spending by middle market and small businesses which grew versus the prior year after adjusting for the effects of costco international billings continued to be strong revenues net of interest expense declined year over year on a reported basis reflecting lower billed business and a decline in card member loans after excluding costco related revenues from the prior year adjusted revenues net of interest expense grew year over year resulting from an increase in adjusted billed business and growth in net card fees across our premium card portfolios net interest income also declined year over year on a reported basis reflecting lower card member loans and higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to an increase in interest rates versus the prior year excluding costco cobrand card related activity from the prior year adjusted net interest income grew year over year as a result of growth in adjusted card member loans table of contents card member loans declined reflecting the sales of the hfs portfolios in the first half of the year adjusted card member loans grew year over year after excluding from the prior year card member loans related to these portfolios provision expenses on a reported basis were also down year over year as the prior period included credit costs associated with the hfs portfolios provision expenses adjusted for these credit costs increased primarily as a result of growth in adjusted card member loans and seasoning of loans related to new card members we expect that continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write off rates due primarily to this seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in provision expenses going forward total expenses decreased versus the prior year reflecting a decline in rewards expense partially offset by an increase in investment spending on growth initiatives the decrease in rewards expense was driven by the costco cobrand expenses included in the prior year and the continued shift in volumes to cash rebate products for which the rewards costs are classified as contra discount revenue after adjusting for the costco cobrand we expect rewards expense including costs associated with cash rebate products to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our card product value propositions over time in addition we expect that our investment spending on growth initiatives including marketing and promotion during the fourth quarter will be significantly higher than in the third quarter competition remains intense across our businesses particularly in the u s while our businesses are global and diversified to remain competitive we need to continue to demonstrate the value we deliver to merchants customers and business partners in all aspects of our relationships more intense

completed the sales of the jetblue and costco cobrand card portfolios respectively for the periods from december 1 2015 through the sale completion dates the primary impacts beyond the hfs

increase for the three month period reflects the absence of costco merchant volumes in the current year which were at a lower discount rate than the average the decrease for the nine month period was driven primarily by a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals growth of the optblue program and merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent european regulatory changes partially offset by the benefit to the discount rate from the decline in costco merchant volumes in the current period we expect the average discount rate will likely decline over time due to further expansion of optblue overall changes in the mix of spending by location and industry merchant incentives and concessions volume related pricing discounts strategic investments

status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express aecb and fsb to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income historically capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements to the extent capital has exceeded business regulatory and rating agency requirements we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u s subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u s parent company the following are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents

business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the loans and receivables being securitized are reported as card member loans and receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of debt securities during the three months ended september 30 2016 no such triggering events occurred liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and our businesses requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to u0095 maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details u0095 maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources u0095 projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios u0095 establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements u0095 incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework table of contents the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the company was in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which it is subject including the lcr for the three months ended september 30 2016 the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of september 30 2016 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 17 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the lending trust on september 12 2016 we extended the lending trust s 2 0 billion facility by one year to mature on september 17 2018 both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of september 30 2016 2 2 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility no amounts were drawn on the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 54 9 billion as of september 30 2016 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of september 30 2016 of 3 0 billion which expires on december 9 2018 as of september 30 2016 no amounts were drawn on this facility certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of september 30 2016 we had approximately 239 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months

adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for the nine months ended september 30 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 4 9 billion and 7 8 billion respectively driven by net income of 4 6 billion and 4 3 billion respectively adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the current period net income includes the 1 2 billion gain on the sales of the hfs portfolios which is presented in net decrease increase in card member receivables and loans including held for sale within cash flows from investing activities the decrease was also driven primarily by impacts from movements in other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operating activities cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans including card member loans and receivables hfs along with gains on sales related thereto as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio for the nine months ended september 30 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by used in investing activities was 10 1 billion and 2 7 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the nine months ended september 30 2015 was primarily driven by the sales of the hfs portfolios cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the nine months ended september 30 2016 and 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 11 2 billion and 7 3 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the nine months ended september 30 2015 primarily resulted from a net decrease in short term borrowings and customer deposits partially offset by lower net repayments of long term debt in the current year as compared to the same period in the prior year table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations in light of the current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased regulatory investigations and enforcement compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms including us and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and rules to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards services or benefits to cardholders and merchants broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread the reserve bank of australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance as discussed below the reserve bank of australia recently amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the merchant s actual cost of card acceptance in the eu in those member states that permit surcharging the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the cost of acceptance on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit which has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in capital and currency markets worldwide the full impact of brexit however remains uncertain a process of negotiation which is likely to take two years or longer will determine the future terms of the u k s relationship with the european union it is unclear at this stage what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the u k from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us table of contents european union payments legislation in 2015 the european union adopted legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry the first part was an eu wide regulation on interchange fees the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revisions to the payment services directive the psd2 the interchange fee regulation was formally adopted in april 2015 the substantive terms as adopted include the following u0095 price caps interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the eu are capped as of december 2015 generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances although we do not have interchange fees and three party networks such as american express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks such as visa and mastercard which have interchange fees when they license third party providers to issue cards and or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent this means for example the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our gns partners in the eu which may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners while the discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped the interchange caps have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps u0095 card acceptance terms anti steering and honor all cards rules across all card networks including non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all cards rules took effect in june 2016 u0095 network licensing in december 2015 the geographic scope of the network licenses that we agree to with our gns partners in the eu was amended to cover the entire eu in order to meet the requirements of the regulation this allows gns partners to actively pursue their american express business throughout the eu including countries where we or other gns partners are present and may undermine the value of licenses granted to some gns partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity to incentivize development of the american express business in relation to a particular country u0095 separation of network processing from june 2016 card networks are required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this provision does not generally apply to three party payment networks such as american express but may be deemed applicable for example where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network u0095 co badging of cards from june 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provisions may harm the american express brand insofar as gns issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards table of contents the psd2 was adopted on november 25 2015 and was published in the official journal of the european union on december 23 2015 each member state has until january 2018 to transpose the psd2 into national law among other terms the published text of psd2 includes provisions that will i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the decision of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer the potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirements will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our gns business and together with requirements in the interchange fee regulation may undermine the value of our gns business in europe australia payments regulation following a formal review of the regulatory framework for card payments in australia the reserve bank of australia adopted new regulations on may 26 2016 including the following u0095 interchange caps as of july 1 2017 the interchange fee paid on visa and mastercard credit transactions must not exceed a weighted average benchmark of 0 50 percent across all transactions with a maximum interchange fee cap of 0 80 percent for each individual credit card transaction u0095 the inclusion of our gns business in australia under interchange regulation which subjects gns payments to bank partners to the same interchange caps and regulations that apply to visa and mastercard credit card transactions in australia effective july 1 2017 u0095 broadening the definition of interchange fees to include any fees paid by networks to card issuing banks as incentives to issue cards as well as any other net payments made to card issuers u0095 increasing the frequency of periodic weighted average benchmark calculations from every three years to quarterly to confirm compliance with the interchange caps in determining compliance all transactions at australian merchants including commercial card transactions but excluding those on foreign issued cards will be taken into consideration u0095 changing the rules on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer as recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer the changes took effect as of september 1 2016 for large merchants and will take effect september 1 2017 for other merchants the inclusion of our gns business under interchange regulation may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners while the discount rates we agree to with merchants do not include an interchange component and are therefore not capped the interchange caps once effective will likely exert downward pressure on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets among other matters the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws moreover the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services including certain of our subsidiaries the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services table of contents the review of products and practices to assess compliance and prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews for example federal banking regulators have recently announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are cooperating with regulators in those reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties on may 5 2016 the cfpb issued a proposed rule that if enacted would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed the cfpb has set a 90 day period for comment with the rule becoming effective 211 days after enactment and applying to all agreements entered into after that date on july 28 2016 the cfpb outlined proposals under consideration that would set forth additional requirements for third party debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course this proposal is part of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule if any becoming effective before 2018 as of march 1 2017 regulations implementing dodd frank s margin requirements would result in us collecting and remitting cash and or securities collateral relative to the value of certain uncleared derivative transactions variation margin which may create or increase collateral posting requirements for us antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court had ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction we appealed this judgment and on september 26 2016 the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for american express we continue to vigorously defend similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings for a description of the doj case and part i item 3 legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2015 the 2015 form 10 k for descriptions of the related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business see

gaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans and loans hfs which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of

environment for the quarter ended june 30 2016 earnings included a gain of 1 1 billion 677 million after tax from the previously announced sale of our costco wholesale corporation costco u s cobrand card portfolio a 232 million 151 million after tax restructuring charge related to our on going cost reduction efforts together with a continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives during the quarter we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives in addition we used our capital strength to repurchase 1 7 billion of outstanding shares the year over year growth in worldwide billings for the second quarter adjusted for foreign currency exchange rates slowed versus the first quarter as a result of a continued slowdown in costco related volumes leading up to the date of the portfolio sale international volumes continued to be strong and performance remained relatively consistent sequentially across most regions revenues net of interest expense decreased modestly as compared to the prior year similar to last quarter we experienced a year over year decline in the discount rate from the continued expansion of optblue and merchant negotiations including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the eu that went into effect late last year discount revenue growth was also impacted by an increase in contra discount revenues as compared to the prior year primarily related to cash rebate rewards in addition in the prior year both the discount rate and discount revenue benefited from certain merchant rebate accruals net interest income grew as compared to the prior year although growth slowed sequentially due primarily to the sales of the costco and jetblue cobrand card portfolios as well as the continued decline in costco loans prior to the portfolio sale in june card member loans were down in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year reflecting the sales of the two cobrand card portfolios in the first half of this year excluding the card member loans related to the costco and jetblue portfolios from the prior year table of contents worldwide loan growth during the quarter was sequentially consistent with a portion of the growth coming from increased usage of other american express cards by former costco cobrand card members we continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high quality prospects without significantly changing our overall credit risk profile provision expenses were down modestly and credit quality remained strong during the quarter the prior period included credit costs associated with the costco and jetblue cobrand card portfolios subsequently classified as held for sale the credit costs associated with the costco portfolio for the current quarter were reported in other expense we expect some modest upward pressure on our write off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members total expenses decreased significantly as compared to the prior year reflecting the costco cobrand portfolio sale gain which was classified as an expense reduction in other expense excluding the costco portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge during the current quarter total expenses grew modestly and reflect a continued elevated level of investment spending on growth initiatives we expect our investment spending during 2016 including marketing and promotion will be at a higher level than 2015 rewards expense declined in the second quarter driven by a shift in volumes to cash rebate products for which the rewards costs are classified as contra discount revenue relative to the first half of the year we continue to anticipate earnings will be lower during the second half of the year due to the end of our relationship with costco in the u s and our higher level of spending on growth initiatives overall we remain focused on accelerating revenue growth optimizing investments and resetting our cost base see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in other matters for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the department of justice doj

a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals growth of the optblue program and merchant negotiations including those resulting from the recent european regulatory changes we expect the average discount rate will likely decline by a greater amount during 2016 than 2015 due to the further expansion of optblue a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued

periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the loans and receivables being securitized are reported as card member loans and receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of debt securities during the three months ended june 30 2016 no such triggering events occurred as previously disclosed we completed the sale of substantially all of our

amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy the company was in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which it is subject including the lcr for the three months ended june 30 2016 the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs to maintain these resources have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of june 30 2016 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving

secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 53 billion as of june 30 2016 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria table of contents committed bank credit facilities in

members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members cash flows the following table

operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for the six months ended june 30 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 3 1 billion and 4 2 billion respectively driven by net income of 3 4 billion and 3 0 billion respectively adjusted for non cash items including changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the decrease in the current period as compared to the six months ended june 30 2015 primarily resulted from offsetting impacts from movements in other assets and accounts

and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends table of contents for the six months ended june 30 2016 and 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 4 3 billion and 2 4 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the six months ended june 30 2015 primarily resulted from a net decrease in short term borrowings and customer deposits in the current year period as compared to the prior year period as well as higher common share repurchases in the current year period partially offset by lower net repayments of long term debt repayments in the current year as compared to the same period in the prior year other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations in light of the current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased regulatory investigations and enforcement compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms including us and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and rules to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards services or benefits to cardholders and merchants broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread the reserve bank of australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance as discussed below the reserve bank of australia recently amended its rules to limit surcharging in australia to the merchant s actual cost of card acceptance in the eu in those member states that permit surcharging the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the cost of acceptance on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit which has caused and may continue to cause table of contents significant volatility in capital and currency markets worldwide the full impact of brexit however remains uncertain a process of negotiation which is likely to take two years or longer will determine the future terms of the u k s relationship with the european union it is unclear at this stage what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the u k from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us european union payments legislation in 2015 the european union adopted legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry the first part was an eu wide regulation on interchange fees the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revisions to the payment services directive the psd2 the interchange fee regulation was formally adopted in april 2015 the substantive terms as adopted include the following price caps interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the eu are capped as of december 2015 generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances although we do not have interchange fees and three party networks such as american express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks such as visa and mastercard which have interchange fees when they license third party providers to issue cards and or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent this means for example the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our gns partners in the eu which may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners while the discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped the interchange caps have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps card acceptance terms anti steering and honor all cards rules across all card networks including non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all cards rules took effect in june 2016 network licensing in december 2015 the geographic scope of the network licenses that we agree to with our gns partners in the eu was amended to cover the entire eu in order to meet the requirements of the regulation this allows gns partners to actively pursue their american express business throughout the eu including countries where we or other gns partners are present and may undermine the value of licenses granted to some gns partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity to incentivize development of the american express business in relation to a particular country separation of network processing from june 2016 card networks are required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this provision does not generally apply to three party payment networks such as american express but may be deemed applicable for example where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network table of contents co badging of cards from june 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provisions may harm the american express brand insofar as gns issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards the psd2 was adopted on november 25 2015 and was published in the official journal of the european union on december 23 2015 each member state has until january 2018 to transpose the psd2 into national law among other terms the published text of psd2 includes provisions that will i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the decision of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer the potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirements will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our gns business and together with requirements in the interchange fee regulation may undermine the value of our gns business in europe australia payments regulation following a formal review of the regulatory framework for card payments in australia the reserve bank of australia adopted new regulations on may 26 2016 including the following interchange caps as of july 1 2017 the interchange fee paid on visa and mastercard credit transactions must not exceed a weighted average benchmark of 0 50 percent across all transactions with a maximum interchange fee cap of 0 80 percent for each individual credit card transaction the inclusion of our gns business in australia under interchange regulation which subjects gns payments to bank partners to the same interchange caps and regulations that apply to visa and mastercard credit card transactions in australia effective 1 july 2017 broadening the definition of interchange fees to include any fees paid by networks to card issuing banks as incentives to issue cards as well as any other net payments made to card issuers increasing the frequency of periodic weighted average benchmark calculations from every three years to quarterly to confirm compliance with the interchange caps in determining compliance all transactions at australian merchants including commercial card transactions but excluding those on foreign issued cards will be taken into consideration changing the rules on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer as recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer the changes take effect as of september 1 2016 for large merchants and september 1 2017 for other merchants the inclusion of our gns business under interchange regulation may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners while the discount rates we agree to with merchants do not include an interchange table of contents component and are therefore not capped the interchange caps once effective will likely exert downward pressure on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets among other matters the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which

is directed to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties on may 5 2016 the cfpb issued a proposed rule that if enacted would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed the cfpb has set a 90 day period for comment with the rule becoming effective 211 days after enactment and applying to all agreements entered into after that date antitrust litigation the u s doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court has ruled that the

charges in future quarters that in the aggregate will likely be significant as we continue our cost reduction efforts billings growth for the first quarter as compared to the prior year increased sequentially reflecting a benefit from the leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth partially offset by a year over year decline in u s billings related to costco wholesale corporation costco as we move closer to the end of the costco relationship in the united states in june within gcs we continue to see differing performance trends with better growth among small and middle market businesses as compared to more cautious spending among global and large corporate customers internationally billings growth after adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates remained strong as compared to the prior year driven by china korea japan and the uk although there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within china and korea table of contents revenues net of interest expense grew as compared to the prior year driven by net interest income card member spending which increased despite a slowdown in costco related spending and net card fees this growth was partially offset by the higher costs associated with cash back rewards and a greater decline in the reported average discount rate which was due to the continued expansion of optblue merchant negotiations changes in industry mix and the impact from regulatory changes enacted in the eu late last year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by a stronger u s dollar although this impact was smaller than in recent quarters growth in net interest income remained strong during the quarter driven primarily by loan growth card member loans held for investment were down in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to the transfer of the costco u s cobrand loan portfolio to card member loans and receivables held for sale effective december 1 2015 and the sale of the jetblue cobrand portfolio this quarter excluding the costco and jetblue cobrand portfolios from the prior year worldwide loans increased driven by growth in both card member loans and loans related to our merchant financing products we continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company excluding from the prior year credit costs related to the costco and jetblue cobrand portfolios which are reported in other expenses for the first quarter of 2016 our credit provision increased year over year as a result of an increase in overall loan balances including our merchant financing loans although card member lending write off rates were slightly lower versus the prior year we expect continued growth in loans held for investment will contribute to an increase in provisions for losses we also expect to see some upward pressure on our write off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members our strong capital position allowed us to return substantially all of the capital we generated in the first quarter to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while maintaining strong capital ratios we continue to believe our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders while maintaining our capital ratios illustrates the strength of our balance sheet and business model as mentioned above we expect our relationship with costco in the united states to end in june the ultimate gain on the sale of the costco cobrand portfolio will be determined based on the assets actually sold but we continue to estimate a gain of approximately 1 billion although given that card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition the final gain could differ from our estimate we expect the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund spending on growth initiatives throughout 2016 we expect total spending on growth initiatives during 2016 to be consistent with 2015 levels relative to the first quarter of 2016 we expect earnings per share to be higher during the second quarter as a result of the costco portfolio sale gain with lower earnings during the second half of 2016 following the end of the costco relationship as of march 31 2016 costco cobrand accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of our total cards in force costco cobrand accounts generated approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business during the first quarter of 2016 approximately 70 percent of the spending on these accounts occurred outside costco warehouses in addition 1 percent of our worldwide billed business during the first quarter of 2016 came from spending on other non costco cobrand american express cards at costco in the united states see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in other matters for information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the department of justice doj case and related merchant litigations on our business as well as other legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to our cobrand partnerships with costco in the united states and jetblue the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs included in the uscs and gcs segments on the consolidated balance sheets the sale of jetblue was completed on march 18 2016 the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets are to provisions for losses and credit metrics which no longer reflect amounts related to these loans and receivables as credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield continue to reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the relative strengthening of the u s dollar over the periods of comparison has had an impact on our results of operations where meaningful in describing our

profitability of our business table of contents table 2 total revenue net of interest expense summary total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue remained relatively flat for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year and increased 1 percent on an fx adjusted basis driven by 3 percent growth in billed business 6 percent on an fx adjusted basis partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and increases in contra discount revenues such as higher cash rebate rewards including new card member acquisition offers 1 u s billed business increased 4 percent and non u s billed business increased 2 percent 9 percent on an fx adjusted basis compared to the same period in the prior year 1 the average discount rate was 2 44 percent and 2 49 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease was driven in part by growth of the optblue program merchant negotiations changes in industry mix and impacts from european regulatory changes we expect the average discount rate will likely decline by a greater amount during 2016 than 2015 due to the continued expansion of optblue a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures more broadly overall changes in the mix of spending by location and industry merchant incentives and concessions volume related pricing discounts strategic investments certain pricing initiatives competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate net card fees increased 32 million or 5 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher proprietary cards in force other fees and commissions decreased 28 million or 4 percent

three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher revenues from our prepaid services business interest income increased 148 million or 8 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflecting an increase in average card member loans including card member loans hfs and a higher yield

expense increased 15 million or 4 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher average customer deposit balances partially

valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses increased 118 million or 19 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the

million or 4 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year the current period increase was primarily driven by higher membership rewards expense of 49 million and higher cobrand rewards expense of 14 million the increase in membership rewards expense was primarily driven by an increase in new points earned as a result of higher spending volumes the increase in cobrand rewards expense was primarily driven by higher spending volumes partially offset by a continued decline in spending on the costco cobrand card portfolio the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr for current program participants was 95 percent rounded down at march 31 2016 compared to 95 percent rounded up at march 31 2015 card member services and other expenses increased 21 million or 8 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by growth in proprietary cards in force as well as increased usage of

restructuring in the current year other expenses increased 21 million or 2 percent for the three months ended march 31 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the benefit in the prior year from both the reassessment of the functional currency of certain uk legal entities and other fx related activity the increase was also driven by the impact of the transfer of the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs as related credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment both of which were partially offset by the gain on the sale of the jetblue card member loans hfs portfolio as well as lower fraud expense in the current year income taxes the effective tax rate was 34 7 percent and 34 2 percent for the three

historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as

weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off

march 31 2015 primarily resulted from offsetting impacts from movements in other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operating activities cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans including card member loans and receivables hfs as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio for the three months ended march 31 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by investing activities was 3 7 billion and 2 8 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the three months ended march 31 2015 was primarily driven by the sale of the jetblue portfolio and a decrease in the remaining hfs portfolio balances cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the three months ended march 31 2016 and 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 3 9 billion and 3 5 billion respectively the increase in the current period as compared to the three months ended march 31 2015 primarily resulted from a higher net decrease in short term borrowings and higher common share repurchases in the current year partially offset by lower net long term debt repayments in the current year as compared to the same period in the prior year table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations in light of the current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased regulatory investigations and enforcement compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms including us and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and rules to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards services or benefits to cardholders and merchants broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread the reserve bank of australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance in the eu in those member states that permit surcharging the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance european union payments legislation in 2015 the european union adopted legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry the first part was an eu wide regulation on interchange fees the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revisions to the payment services directive the psd2 the interchange fee regulation was formally adopted in april 2015 the substantive terms as adopted include the following u0095 price caps interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the eu are capped as of december 2015 generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge table of contents cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances although we do not have interchange fees and three party networks such as american express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks such as visa and mastercard which have interchange fees when they license third party providers to issue cards and or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent this means for example the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our gns partners in the eu which may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners while the discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped the interchange caps have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps u0095 card acceptance terms anti steering and honor all cards rules across all card networks including non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all cards rules takes effect in june 2016 u0095 network licensing in december 2015 the geographic scope of the network licenses that we agree to with our gns partners in the eu was amended to cover the entire eu in order to meet the requirements of the regulation this allows gns partners to actively pursue their american express business throughout the eu including countries where we or other gns partners are present and may undermine the value of licenses granted to some gns partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity to incentive development of the american express business in relation to a particular country u0095 separation of network processing from june 2016 card networks will be required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this provision does not generally apply to three party payment networks such as american express but may be deemed applicable for example where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network u0095 co badging of cards from june 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provisions may harm the american express brand insofar as gns issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards the psd2 was adopted on november 25 2015 and was published in the official journal of the european union on december 23 2015 each member state has until january 2018 to transpose the psd2 into national law among other terms the published text of psd2 includes provisions that will i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the decision of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer the potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirements will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our gns business and together with requirements in the interchange fee regulation may undermine the value of our gns business in europe table of contents australia payments regulation following a formal review of the regulatory framework for card payments in australia the reserve bank of australia published a consultation paper on december 3 2015 proposing new regulations including the following u0095 interchange caps the interchange fee paid on visa and mastercard credit transactions must not exceed a weighted average benchmark of 0 50 percent across all transactions with a maximum interchange fee cap of 0 80 percent for each individual credit card transaction u0095 the inclusion of our gns business in australia under interchange regulation which would subject gns payments to bank partners to the same interchange caps and regulations that apply to visa and mastercard credit card transactions in australia u0095 broadening the definition of interchange fees to include any fees paid by networks to card issuing banks as incentives to issue cards as well as any other net payments made to card issuers u0095 increasing the frequency of periodic weighted average benchmark calculations from every three years to quarterly and including all transactions at australian merchants in benchmark calculations thereby capturing foreign issued cards which had previously been excluded u0095 changing the rules on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual costs of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer as recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer the industry consultation process is now complete the reserve bank of australia is expected to publish its final amended standards and consultation findings together with implementation timeframes by mid 2016 dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets among other matters the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws moreover the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services including certain of our subsidiaries the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties on october 7 2015 the cfpb announced a proposal that would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed this proposal is the beginning of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule if any becoming effective before 2018 table of contents antitrust litigation the u s doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court has ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction effective july 20 2015 prohibiting us from enforcing certain elements of such provisions in the united states we appealed this judgment and on december 18 2015 the court of appeals for the second circuit stayed the trial court s judgment pending the issuance of its appellate decision we are also vigorously defending similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see part i item 3

four reportable operating segments u s card services uscs international card services ics global commercial services gcs and global network merchant services gnms refer to business for a discussion of changes to our reportable operating segments effective in the first quarter of 2016 we provide our customers with access to products insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world business travel related services are offered through a non consolidated joint venture american express global business travel gbt jv prior to july 1 2014 these business travel operations were wholly owned we compete in the global payments industry with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers as well as evolving and growing alternative payment providers as the payments industry continues to evolve we

to our cobrand partnerships with costco wholesale corporation costco in the united states and jetblue airways corporation jetblue the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables held for sale hfs on the consolidated balance sheets refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information non gaap measures we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap however certain information included within this report constitutes non gaap financial measures our calculations of non gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies business environment our performance in 2015 reflected both the strength of our business and the headwinds we have been managing throughout the year results for the year benefited from healthy loan growth strong card acquisitions excellent credit performance disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position our results were also challenged by several factors first the cumulative impact from the initial increased costs associated with early renewals of certain of our cobrand relationships and the end of our relationship with costco in canada negatively impacted our results second the u s dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed third our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year consistent with the elevated levels of 2014 further pressured our 2015 earnings fourth the economic regulatory and competitive environments all became even more challenging as the year progressed the combination of these factors resulted in billings and revenue growth rates that were fairly steady throughout the year billings did grow in 2015 although growth rates decelerated modestly during the second half of the year international billed business continued to be strong versus the prior year after excluding canada due to the termination of our relationship with costco canada last year and adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates in the united states we saw softening in billings on the costco cobrand card where volumes dropped versus the prior year lower gas prices also continued to be a drag on billings gcs billed business growth continued to slow due in part to lower airline volumes and a generally cautious corporate spending environment our billings growth rates during the second half of 2016 will be impacted by the end of our relationship with costco in the united states which is expected to occur around mid year for the full year discount revenue was down slightly versus the prior year driven in part by a decline in our discount rate due primarily to the continued rollout of optblue and we anticipate that the discount rate will further decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of optblue a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures table of contents growth in net interest income remained strong during the year driven by loan growth card member loans held for investment were down in 2015 on a reported basis due to the transfer of the costco and jetblue loan portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs effective december 1 2015 excluding the hfs portfolios from the prior year worldwide loans increased we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment in 2016 and continue to believe there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing our overall risk profile our credit provision was down versus the prior year as lending write off rates remained at lower levels we expect continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provisions we also expect to see some upward pressure on our write off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members our capital position allowed us to return over 5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases representing approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year reflecting our ongoing commitment to using our capital strength to create value for our shareholders as mentioned above we are now reporting the costco portfolio as hfs we expect the sale to close around mid year 2016 and that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close the ultimate gain on sale will be determined based on the assets actually sold but we currently estimate a gain of approximately 1 billion we have not yet signed a definitive agreement and given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and paydown trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition the final gain could differ from our estimate we expect the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund spending on growth initiatives throughout 2016 resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance as of december 31 2015 costco cobrand accounts were responsible for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide card member loans held for investment and hfs combined and approximately 10 percent of our total cards in force costco cobrand accounts generated approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 70 percent of the spending on these accounts occurred outside costco warehouses in addition 1 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2015 came from spending on other non costco cobrand american express cards at costco warehouses in an effort to accelerate and expand our cost control efforts to right size our cost base with the evolving business environment we have launched in the first quarter of 2016 cost initiatives that are designed to remove 1 billion from our overall cost base which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion costs by the end of 2017 we plan to take action throughout 2016 to drive benefits in 2017 and beyond which we expect will result in restructuring charges in 2016 see legal

business table of contents consolidated results of operations as a result of the gbt jv transaction we deconsolidated the global business travel net assets effective june 30 2014 resulting in a lack of comparability between the periods presented as mentioned previously effective december 1 2015 we transferred the card member loans and receivables related to the hfs portfolios included in the uscs segment to card member loans and receivables hfs on the consolidated balance sheets the primary impacts beyond the hfs classification on the consolidated balance sheets are to provisions for losses and credit metrics which no longer reflect amounts related to these loans and receivables as credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment other non credit related metrics i e billed business cards in force net interest yield continue to reflect amounts related to the hfs portfolios refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional

31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we believe rotce is a useful measure of the profitability of our business table 2 total revenues net of interest expense summary table of contents total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 798 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by 2 percent and 7 percent growth in billed business respectively offset by a decline in the average discount rate faster growth in gns billings than in overall company billings increases in contra discount revenues such as cash rebate rewards and higher payments during 2015 related to cobrand partnership agreements u s billed business increased 5 percent and non u s billed business increased 8 percent on an fx adjusted basis in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increases in average spending per proprietary basic card and basic cards in force 1 the average discount rate was 2 46 percent 2 48 percent and 2 51 percent for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in the average discount rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven in part by growth of the optblue program to expand card acceptance by u s small merchants changes in industry mix and competition partially offset by the decline in costco merchant volume in canada which was at a lower discount rate than the average due to the expiration of our merchant agreement the average discount rate will likely decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of optblue a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures overall changes in the mix of spending by location and industry merchant incentives and concessions volume related pricing discounts strategic investments certain pricing initiatives competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate net card fees remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 81 million or 3 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 while fx adjusted net card fees increased 5 percent in both periods 1 the increases in both years on an fx adjusted basis were primarily driven by higher average proprietary cards in force the current year increase also reflects a benefit from certain pricing initiatives travel commissions and fees decreased 769 million or 69 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 795 million or 42 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decreases in both years were primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods other commissions and fees remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 94 million or 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 fx adjusted other commissions and fees increased 9 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 1 the increases on an fx adjusted basis in both periods were primarily driven by higher loyalty coalition revenues as well as higher delinquency fees other revenues decreased 956 million or 32 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 715 million or 31 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in the current year was primarily driven by prior year gains related to the sales of investment securities in concur and the sales of investment securities in industrial and commercial bank of china the increase in the prior year was primarily driven by the gains on the sales of our investment securities in concur revenues earned related to the gbt jv transition services agreement and higher loyalty edge revenues partially offset by the loss of revenue from the publishing business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013 interest income increased 366 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 174 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in both years primarily reflects higher average card member loans partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities driven by lower average investment securities interest expense decreased 84 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 251 million or 13 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in both years was primarily driven by a lower cost of funds on debt and customer deposits partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances 1 the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u s dollars e g assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared certain amounts included in the calculations of foreign currency adjusted revenues and expenses which constitute non gaap measures are subject to management allocations we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates table of contents table 3 provisions for losses summary a effective december 1 2015 provisions for losses does not reflect provisions related to the hfs portfolios provisions for losses charge card provision for losses decreased 55 million or 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 144 million or 22 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in the current year primarily reflects a reserve release versus a reserve build in 2014 partially offset by higher write offs the increase in the prior year was primarily due to a slower reserve rate improvement in 2014 versus 2013 higher corporate card write offs and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2013 card member loans provision for losses increased 52 million or 5 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 23 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in the current year primarily reflects a reserve build versus a reserve release in 2014 the reserve build in the current year was due to a small increase in delinquency rates combined with an increase in loan balances partially offset by lower write offs and the impact related to transferring the hfs portfolios to card member loans and receivables hfs as related credit costs are reported in other expenses through a valuation allowance adjustment beginning in december 2015 the increase in the prior year was driven by higher average card member loans a slower improvement in the reserve rate and the effects of changes in other loss reserve assumptions resulting in a lower reserve release compared to 2013 partially offset by the benefit of lower net write offs due to improved credit performance other provision for losses decreased 53 million or 46 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 45 million or 65 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in the current year and increase in the prior year were due in part to a merchant related charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 table 4 expenses summary a effective december 1 2015 other net includes the valuation allowance adjustment associated with the hfs portfolios expenses marketing and promotion expenses decreased 107 million or 3 percent although they increased 1 percent on an fx adjusted basis in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 277 million or 9 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 2 both periods reflect elevated levels of spending on growth initiatives card member rewards expenses increased 65 million or 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 474 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the current year increase was primarily driven by higher cobrand rewards expense of 199 million driven by rate impacts as a result of cobrand partnership renewal costs partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of 134 million the latter was primarily driven by slower growth in the ultimate redemption rate urr and a decline in the weighted average cost wac per point assumption including 2 refer to footnote 1 on page 55 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information table of contents the impact of the 109 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the delta partnership renewal partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned driven by higher spending volumes the prior year increase was primarily due to higher membership rewards expense of 263 million driven by a 266 million increase related to new points earned in line with higher spending volumes and a higher wac per point assumption including the impact of the previously mentioned charge related to the delta partnership renewal these increases were offset by slower average growth in the urr cobrand rewards expense increased 211 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by higher spending volumes card member services and other expenses increased 196 million or 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 55 million or 7 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in the current year was primarily due to higher costs related to certain previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements the increase in the prior year was primarily driven by increased engagement levels and use of certain card member benefits as well as american express branded airport lounges opened in 2014 salaries and employee benefits expenses decreased 1 1 billion or 18 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and 96 million or 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in both years was primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods the decrease in the current year was also driven by restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and lower compensation costs in 2015 as a result of those initiatives in 2014 compared to 2013 those restructuring charges partially offset the impact of the business travel joint venture transaction other expenses increased 704 million or 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased 707 million or 10 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in the current year reflects the net gain from the 2014 business travel joint venture transaction partially offset by the eg charge discussed previously refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the charge the decrease in the prior year was primarily driven by the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods and a charge in 2013 related to the rejected merchant litigation settlement see legal proceedings for further information on this merchant litigation income taxes the effective tax rate was 35 0 percent in 2015 compared to 34 5 percent in 2014 and 32 1 percent in 2013 the tax rates for 2015 2014 and 2013 include benefits of 33 million expenses of 40 million and benefits of 150 million respectively related to the resolution of certain prior years items the tax rate for 2015 also includes the impact of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge in eg the tax rates for all periods reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and geographic mix of business table of contents table 5 selected statistical information a in the three months ended march 31 2015 we changed the classification related to certain payments to partners reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense the misclassification in prior periods has been revised to conform to the current period presentation accordingly the average discount rate for prior periods was also revised resulting in a reduction of between zero and one basis point in any period from what was originally reported b average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only average fee per card is computed based on net card fees including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards in force the average fee per card adjusted which is a non gaap measure is computed in the same manner but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs the amount of amortization excluded was 283 million 306 million and 262 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we present the average fee per card adjusted because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of our

rebate rewards from new card member acquisition offers and payments under previously renewed cobrand partnership agreements the increase in billed business was primarily driven by 6 percent higher cards in force and a 1 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card net interest income increased 481 million or 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher interest income resulting from higher average card member loans partially offset by higher interest expense total revenues net of interest expense increased 919 million or 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by higher discount revenue as a result of 8 percent growth in billed business partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and higher cash rebate rewards the increase also

us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions inclusive of transition provisions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets see section on transitional basel iii the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1 2019 see section on fully phased in basel iii we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting at which point we will begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk based capital ratios

ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income historically capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements to the extent capital has exceeded business regulatory and rating agency requirements we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u s subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u s parent company the following are definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents using risk conversion factors before being allocated a risk adjusted weight the

based capital ratios this difference between tier 1 capital which includes common equity and qualifying preferred securities and common equity tier 1 is also present in the minimum capital requirements within comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar we issued 750 million of preferred shares in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 850 million in the first quarter of 2015 the preferred shares issuances help to finance a portion of the tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements our 750 million of subordinated debentures which prior to 2014 were fully included in tier 2 capital but not in tier 1 capital do not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii the phase out of the subordinated debentures from tier 2 capital began in the first quarter of 2014 and will be fully phased out on january 1 2016 which affects our total risk based capital ratio at our option the subordinated debentures are redeemable for cash on or after september 1 2016 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest we currently intend to exercise this redemption option subject to business and market conditions as previously mentioned we issued 600 million of subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2014 which qualifies as tier 2 capital under basel rules our total risk based capital ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum table of contents the following table presents a comparison of our common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk based capital under transitional basel iii rules to our estimated common

outstanding and more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the year ended december 31 2015 we returned 5 6 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends 1 1 billion and share repurchases 4 5 billion we repurchased 58 8 million common shares at an average price of 76 70 in 2015 these dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 105 percent of total capital generated during the year the amount of capital we generated in 2015 significantly exceeded the capital required to finance organic business growth and acquisitions the proposed sales of the hfs loan portfolios are expected to all else remaining constant increase our capital ratios due to the reduction in risk weighted assets this additional capital flexibility may be used to support growth in loans potential acquisitions distributions to shareholders or a combination thereof beginning in 2016 participating ccar firms are now required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the federal reserve on or before april 5 of each year instead of on or before january 5 of each year as previously required the federal reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in ccar 2016 including the reasons for any objection to capital plans by june 30 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2015 we had 750 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred shares the series b preferred shares and 850 million of non cumulative perpetual preferred shares the series c preferred

funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes including acquisition activities funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and third party distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debentures asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and long term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non u s regions we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december 31 table 21 summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time our funding plan for the full year 2016 includes among other sources approximately 3 billion to 7 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and up to 3 billion of secured term debt issuance our funding plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and

could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of u s retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs short term funding programs short term borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of 12 months or less as well as interest bearing overdrafts with banks our short term funding programs are used primarily to meet working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of short term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions we had the following short term borrowings outstanding as of december 31 table 23 short term borrowings outstanding refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our american express centurion bank centurion bank and american express bank fsb american express bank subsidiaries together the banks these funds are currently insured up to 250 000 per

asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member receivables and loans arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as card member receivables and loans on our consolidated balance sheets with a portion also included in card member loans and receivables hfs and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of investor securities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 no such triggering events occurred table of contents liquidity management we incur liquidity risk that arises in the course of offering our products and services our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and our businesses requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months our liquidity risk policy sets out our objectives and approach to managing liquidity risk the liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a wide variety of scenarios our liquidity management strategy thus includes a number of elements including but not limited to u0095 maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details u0095 maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources u0095 projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios u0095 establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements u0095 incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on balance sheet and off balance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and abs conduit facilities through our u s bank subsidiaries we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market wide firm specific and combined liquidity stresses the lcr rule prescribes cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes qualifying criteria for high quality liquid assets we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements the investment income we receive on liquidity resources such as cash is less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the net interest costs on these amounts have been substantial the level of future net interest costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december 31 2015 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust together with the lending trust the trusts we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 15 2017 that gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december 31 2015 1 0 billion was drawn on the charge trust facility and 0 1 billion was drawn on the lending trust facility both of which were subsequently repaid on january 15 2016 federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 50 9 billion as of december 31 2015 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria table of contents committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december 31 2015 of 3 0 billion which expires on december 9 2018 the availability of this credit line is subject to our compliance with certain financial covenants principally the maintenance by american express credit corporation credco of a certain ratio of combined earnings and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with each of our covenants as of december 31 2015 no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility the capacity of the facility mainly served to further enhance our contingent funding resources our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows billions 2015 2014

adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for december 31 2015 and 2014 net cash provided by operating activities remained consistent at 11 0 billion in both periods driven by net income of 5 2 billion and 5 9 billion respectively adjusted for non cash items including certain changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans including card member loans and receivables hfs as well as changes in our available for sale investment securities portfolio for the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 8 2 billion and 8 0 billion respectively both periods primarily reflect an increase in card member receivables and loans including the hfs portfolios in 2014 that increase was partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in concur cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the year ended december 31 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 2 0 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash provided by financing activities was 11 million the variance was primarily driven by an increase in debt repayments in the current year versus the prior year partially offset by a greater increase in customer deposits in the current year versus the prior year table

minimum required contributions and no contributions are currently planned for the u s american express retirement plan for the u s american express retirement restoration plan and non u s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in 2016 are anticipated to be approximately 44 million and this amount has been included within other long term liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating 726 million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other long term liabilities do not include 6 7 billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered long term liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable d the purchase obligation amounts represent either the early termination fees or non cancelable minimum contractual obligations as applicable by period under contracts that were in effect as of december 31 2015 e represents obligations to make payments under contractual agreements with certain cobrand partners we expect to fully satisfy these obligations over the remaining term of these agreements as part of the ongoing operations of our business in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table 27 we have off balance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our principal guarantees are associated with card member services to enhance the value of owning an american express card as of december 31 2015 we had guarantees totaling approximately 48 billion related to card member protection plans as well as other guarantees and indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 297 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members to mitigate counterparty credit risk related to derivatives we accepted non cash collateral in the form of security interests in u s treasury securities from its derivatives counterparties with a fair value of nil and 91 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively none of which was sold or repledged refer to notes 7 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our other off balance sheet arrangements table of contents risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the general auditor and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes controls talent and capabilities the board monitors the tone at the top our risk culture and oversees emerging and strategic risks the risk committee of our board of directors provides oversight on risk policies risk appetite and our performance against goals the risk committee approves our erm policy along with its sub policies governing individual credit risk institutional credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk reputational risk and asset liability risk as well as policies governing the launch of new products and services third party management and resolution planning the erm policy defines our risk appetite as well as governance over risk taking and oversight processes risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures well within our risk capacity even under stressed forward looking scenarios in addition it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring limits escalation triggers and assessing control programs the risk committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our chief risk officer and receives regular updates from the chief risk officer on key risks transactions and exposures the risk committee reviews our credit risk profile as well as credit risk performance trends and risk management capabilities the risk committee also reviews enterprise wide operational risk trends events and capabilities with an emphasis on compliance fraud legal process or control failures information security and privacy as well as trends in market funding liquidity and reputational risks the risk committee also provides oversight of our compliance with basel capital and liquidity standards and its internal capital adequacy assessment process including its ccar submissions and resolution planning the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors approves our compliance policies and risk tolerance and reinforces the importance of our compliance risk management in addition the audit and compliance committee reviews the effectiveness of our corporate wide compliance risk management program more broadly this committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process internal and external auditing including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function and the integrity of our systems of internal accounting and financial controls the audit and compliance committee provides oversight of our internal audit group the audit and compliance committee reviews and concurs in the appointment replacement performance and compensation of our general auditor and approves internal audit s annual audit plan charter policies and budget the audit and compliance committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan s status and results including significant reports issued by internal audit and the status of our corrective actions the compensation and benefits committee of our board of directors works with the chief risk officer to ensure our overall compensation programs as well as those covering our business units and risk taking employees appropriately balance risk with business incentives and how business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk our chief risk officer is actively involved in setting goals including for our business units our chief risk officer also reviews the current and forward looking risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation the chief risk officer meets with the compensation and benefits committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks the compensation and benefits committee uses a risk balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives table of contents there are several internal management committees including the enterprise wide risk management committee ermc chaired by our chief risk officer the ermc is the highest level management committee to oversee all firm wide risks it maintains the enterprise wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies companywide with approval by the appropriate board committee the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters economic capital and basel capital trends and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks the ermc is responsible for risk governance risk oversight and risk appetite for all risks which include individual credit risk institutional credit risk operational risk compliance risk reputational risk market risk asset liability management alm risk liquidity risk model risk and strategic and business risk as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking business unit presidents our chief credit officer chief operational risk officer chief market risk officer and functional risk officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk taking activities of the first line the global risk oversight officer and market risk oversight officer the chief compliance ethics officer the corporate comptroller and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing market liquidity asset liability risk and capital credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer to preserve independence chief credit officers for all business units report to our chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises principally from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards lines of credit and loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections externally the risk in these portfolios is correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth which can affect customer liquidity the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the individual credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy this policy is further supported by subordinate policies and operating manuals covering decision logic and processes of credit extension including prospecting new account approvals point of sale authorizations credit line management and collections the subordinate risk policies and operating manuals are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principles and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition individual credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision making models that use the most up to date information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus additional data such as commercial variables are integrated to further mitigate small business risk we have developed data driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our global corporate payments global merchant services gns prepaid services and foreign exchange services businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by client specific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios table of contents similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights of risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk adjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit and a specialized airline risk group provide risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnerships and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see risk factors sovereign debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of our economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december 31 2015 we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk as the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by lead operational risk officers in the business units and staff groups to preserve independence the lead operational risk officers for all business units report to our chief operational risk officer who in turn reports directly to our chief risk officer we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators such as customer complaints or pre implementation test metrics and d process and entity level risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers and or us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues our impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information security privacy and data governance we have implemented an information security framework and operating model that is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management program in addition the committee is responsible for establishing cyber risk tolerances and in managing cyber crisis preparedness the information security oversight team provides challenges and independent assessment of the information security program table of contents we assess our cyber risk across four categories of threat actors that we currently believe pose the greatest risk namely cyber criminals nation state sponsored groups determined insiders and hacktivists or social objectors our information security framework and operating model uses an approach that looks at different phases of security to prepare prevent detect respond and recover from cyber security attacks our privacy framework and operating model follow a similar structure co chaired by the u s chief privacy officer and the international chief privacy officer our privacy risk management committee a sub committee of the ormc provides oversight and governance for our privacy program the committee is responsible for the governance over the collection notice use sharing transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance and data standards for data used in regulatory reporting risk management as well as other critical systems including big data capabilities compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non compliance with applicable laws regulations rules or standards of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate wide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the regulatory risks to which we are exposed we have a comprehensive anti money laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the models and rules used by the anti money laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative publicity regarding our products services business practices management clients and partners whether perceived or real could cause a decline in the customer base costly litigation or revenue reductions we view protecting our reputation as core to our vision of becoming the world s most respected service brand and fundamental to our long term success our business leaders are responsible for ensuring that reputational risk implications of transactions business activities and management practices are appropriately considered and relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc and its sub committees are responsible for reviewing decisions where reputational risk may exist and ensuring that reputational risk considerations are properly reflected market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include u0095 interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between interest rates on our assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and our interest rates on our liabilities such as debt and deposits and u0095 foreign exchange risk related to earnings funding transactions and investments in currencies other than the u s dollar our asset liability management alm and market risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the risk committee of the board of directors market risk is managed by the market risk committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposures for market risk and alm activities as well as ensuring compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments table of contents our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we do not engage in derivative financial instruments for trading purposes refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity as of december 31 2015 the detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 216 million to calculate this effect the projected net interest income over a 12 month time horizon is measured considering forecasted business growth and future interest rates the change in projected net interest income from a 100 basis point increase in rates is measured by increasing our forecast of future interest rates by 100 basis points the timing and loan balances associated with the sales of the hfs loan portfolios are key assumptions in projecting business growth this year the hfs loan portfolio sales if and when completed are expected to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates all else remaining constant we are also subject to market risk from changes in the relationship between the benchmark prime rate that determines the yield on our variable rate lending receivables and the benchmark libor rate that determines the effective interest cost on a significant portion of our outstanding debt differences in the rate of change of these two indices commonly referred to as basis risk would impact our variable rate u s lending net interest margins because we borrow at rates based on libor but lend to our customers based on the prime rate the detrimental effect on our net interest income of a hypothetical 10 basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one month libor over the next 12 months is estimated to be 35 million we currently have approximately 40 billion of prime based variable rate u s lending receivables and 35 billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations the hfs loan portfolios sales are expected to reduce our basis risk exposure all else remaining constant foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways 1 card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency 2 cross currency transactions and balances from our funding activities 3 cross currency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and 4 revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pre tax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december 31 2015 and 2014 foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately 26 billion and 30 billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings as of december 31 2015 with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december 31 2015 with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currencies the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u s dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately 179 million as of december 31 2015 the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a 12 month period even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event table of contents liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following deal committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees table of contents critical accounting estimates refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member losses reserves for card member losses represent our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member receivables and loans as of the balance sheet date as of december 31 2015 this estimate does not reflect card member loans and receivables hfs refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in estimating these losses we use statistical and analytical models that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative components of the reserve the models take into account several factors including delinquency based loss migration rates loss emergence periods and average losses over an appropriate historical period as well as expected future recoveries we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factors that may increase or decrease the reserves for losses on card member receivables and loans the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factors such as environmental trends is not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for card member losses in any quarter as of december 31 2015 a 10 percent increase in our estimate of losses inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member receivables and loans evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserves for losses with a corresponding change to provisions for losses by approximately 149 million this sensitivity analysis is provided as a hypothetical scenario to assess the sensitivity of the provisions for losses it does not represent our expectations for losses in the future nor does it include how other portfolio factors such as delinquency based loss migration rates or recoveries or the amount of outstanding balances may impact the level of reserves for losses and the corresponding impact on the provisions for losses liability for membership rewards expense the membership rewards program is our largest card based rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products certain types of purchases allow card members to also earn bonus points membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel entertainment retail certificates and merchandise points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point is derived from the previous 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our judgment resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing promotion rewards and card member services expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december 31 2015 an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of 100 basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 341 million similarly an increase in the wac per point of 1 basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately 85 million table of contents fair value measurement we hold investment securities and derivative instruments that are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets management makes assumptions and judgments when estimating the fair values of these financial instruments in accordance with fair value measurement and disclosure guidance the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date based on the principal or in the absence of a principal most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability the disclosure guidance establishes a three level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the measurement of fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 followed by the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant observable inputs level 2 with the lowest priority given to the measurement of fair value based on pricing models with significant unobservable inputs level 3 we did not have any level 3 financial instruments measured on a recurring basis during the year ended december 31 2015 investment securities our investment securities are mostly composed of fixed income securities issued by states and municipalities as well as the u s government and agencies the fair market values for our investment securities including investments comprising defined benefit pension plan assets are obtained primarily from pricing services we engage and for each security we receive one price from that pricing service the fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities the pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used as of december 31 2015 and 2014 in addition we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually in addition we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services for reasonableness by comparing the prices from the respective pricing services to valuations obtained from different pricing sources as well as comparing prices to the sale prices received from sold securities at least quarterly in the measurement of fair value for our investment securities even though the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are directly observable from active markets or recent trades of similar securities in inactive markets the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs or how they are modeled could result in a different estimate of fair value other than temporary impairment of investment securities realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in the fair value of investment securities is other than temporary such determination requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery we review and evaluate our investment securities at least quarterly and more often as market conditions may require to identify investment securities that have indications of other than temporary impairments we consider several factors when evaluating debt securities for other than temporary impairment including the determination of the extent to which a decline in the fair value of a security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk with respect to market interest rate risk we assess whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities and whether we are more likely than not to be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of any unrealized losses in determining whether any of our investment securities are other than temporarily impaired a change in facts and circumstances could lead to a change in management judgment about our view on collectability and credit quality of the issuer or the impact of market interest rates on the investment securities any such changes could result in us recognizing an other than temporary impairment loss through earnings derivative instruments our primary derivative instruments are interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward agreements the fair value of our derivative instruments is estimated by using either a third party valuation service that uses proprietary pricing models or by internal pricing models where the inputs to those models are readily observable from actively quoted markets we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by a third party valuation service at least annually to mitigate credit risk arising from our derivative instruments counterparties are required to be pre approved and rated as investment grade in addition we manage certain counterparty credit risks by exchanging cash and non cash collateral under executed credit support agreements the non cash collateral does not reduce the derivative balance included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets but effectively reduces risk exposure as it is available in the event of counterparty default based on the assessment of credit risk of our derivative counterparties we do not have derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustments in the measurement of fair value for our derivative instruments although the underlying inputs used in the pricing models are readily observable from actively quoted markets the pricing models do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in the underlying inputs or how they are modeled could result in a different estimate of fair value table of contents goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our approach and methodology for conducting our goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal multi year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples e g earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the eg goodwill impairment in 2015 we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties table of contents other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued accounting standards section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted average loans represents average card member loans on a

securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as asset backed securities that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans the receivables and loans of our charge trust and lending trust being securitized are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally designed to reflect

other matters contain words such as believe expect estimate anticipate intend plan aim will may should could would likely and similar expressions readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date on which they are made we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following u0095 our ability to grow in the future which will depend in part on the following an acceleration of billed business and revenue growth which could be impacted by among other things weakening economic conditions in the u s or internationally a decline in consumer confidence impacting the willingness and ability of card members to sustain spending a further decline in gas prices a further strengthening of the u s dollar a greater erosion of the average discount rate than expected and lower spending on new cards acquired than estimated our success in addressing competitive pressures and implementing strategies and business initiatives including growing profitable spending through proprietary cobrand and network products increasing penetration among corporate middle market and small business clients expanding our international footprint growing loyalty coalitions and increasing merchant acceptance the timing and impact of any potential sale of the costco u s card member loan portfolio realizing incremental economics associated with the costco u s contract extension which could be impacted by among other things card member behavior including the desire of costco u s card members to continue to use their costco u s cobrand cards and the availability to those card members of other payment forms the impact of any potential restructuring charges or other contingencies including but not limited to litigation related expenses impairments the imposition of fines or civil money penalties an increase in card member reimbursements and changes in reserves credit performance remaining in line with current expectations continued growth of card member loans

accounting changes and reclassifications and our ability to continue executing the share repurchase program u0095 our ability to reduce our overall cost base by 1 billion by the end of 2017 which will depend in part on the timing and financial impact of future reengineering plans including whether we will recognize restructuring charges in future periods which could be impacted by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by potential staff reductions our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates our

of optblue merchant acquirers in signing merchants to accept american express which could be impacted by the pricing set by the merchant acquirers the value proposition offered to small merchants and the efforts of optblue merchant acquirers to sign merchants for american express acceptance as well as the willingness of card members to use american express cards at small merchants and of those merchants to accept american express cards u0095 uncertainty relating to the ultimate outcome of the antitrust lawsuit filed against us by the u s department of justice and certain state attorneys general including the success or failure of our appeal and the impact on existing private merchant cases and potentially additional litigation and or arbitrations u0095 changes affecting our ability or desire to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases including the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the costco u s portfolio sale which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our primary regulators the amount we spend on acquisitions and results of operations and capital needs in any given period u0095 our funding plan for the full year 2016 being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations which will depend on various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity demand for securities we offer regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions u0095 our ability to drive growth by developing and marketing value propositions that appeal to card members and new customers and by offering attractive services and rewards programs which will depend in part on ongoing investment in product innovation marketing and promotion and acquisition efforts including through digital channels our ability to update our systems and platforms to support new products services and benefits competition and brand perceptions and reputation u0095 changes in global economic and business conditions including consumer and business spending the availability and cost of credit unemployment and political conditions all of which may significantly affect spending on american express cards delinquency rates loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations u0095 changes in capital and credit market conditions including sovereign creditworthiness which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios access to capital and cost of capital including changes in interest rates changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts table of contents u0095 legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business including legislative and regulatory changes in the united states such as the actions of the cfpb and dodd frank s stricter regulation of large interconnected financial institutions which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements results of operations or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock actions and potential future actions by the fdic and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts which could impact our abs program or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses the allowance of deductions for significant expenses or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions products and services u0095 changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards competition for cobrand partnerships and the success of marketing promotion or rewards programs u0095 changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners such as bankruptcies restructurings or consolidations involving merchants that represent a significant portion of our business such as the airline industry or our partners in gns or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations u0095 our ability to maintain and expand our presence in the digital payments space including online and mobile channels which will depend on our success in evolving our business models and processes for the digital environment building partnerships and executing programs with companies and utilizing digital capabilities that can be leveraged for future growth and u0095 factors beyond our control such as foreign currency rates fire power loss disruptions in telecommunications severe weather conditions natural disasters health pandemics terrorism cyber attacks or fraud which could significantly affect spending on american express cards delinquency rates loan balances and travel related spending or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions a further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in risk factors above and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission table of contents","item 1a risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10 k based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities strategic business and competitive risks difficult economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions both in the united states and elsewhere around the world uncertain expectations for global economic growth have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for credit and payment products a prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and also tend to decline during general economic downturns further economic instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and business spending in other parts of the world if economic conditions were to worsen we could experience adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition factors such as consumer spending business investment government spending interest rates tax rates fuel and other energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability while the recent drop in oil prices may be beneficial for the u s economy overall it has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the amount of gas spending on our cards an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment lower family income lower consumer spending lower demand for credit lower corporate earnings or lower business investment is likely to materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore such factors may cause our earnings credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting the trading price of our common shares our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with a wide variety of financial payment products including charge credit and debit card networks and issuers paper based transactions e g cash and checks bank transfer models e g wire transfers and ach as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms systems and products such as aggregators and web based payment platforms e g paypal square and amazon wireless payment technologies including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions virtual currencies prepaid systems gift cards mobile payments blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies and other systems linked to payment cards or that provide payment solutions we also compete with technology companies telecommunication providers handset manufacturers large retailers and retailer coalitions that are seeking to integrate more financial services into their product offerings we are the fourth largest general purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume behind china unionpay visa and mastercard and we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most countries as a result competitive card issuers and acquirers on the visa and mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of visa and mastercard some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have including larger cash reserves may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategies to achieve broader brand recognition cobrand card table of contents programs or merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of debit cards issued on competitive networks as well as adoption of payment systems based on ach or other payment mechanisms to the extent alternative payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed loop network could be negatively impacted if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers and or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments fee based services and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions in addition companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method preferences through digital wallets mobile applications or at the point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress use of our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets and applications impacting our profitability on transactions laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes more restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure see ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source in recent years we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing market pressure including pressure created by regulatory mandated reductions to competitors pricing to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives we also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower expense bases that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives and or concessions we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives in addition differentiated payment models and technologies from non traditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietary branded mobile wallets and the currentc app on the merchant customer exchange using both traditional and new technology platforms if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volumes a continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results if we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volumes increasing other sources of revenue such as fee based revenue or interest income or both we may not succeed in sustaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added services to merchants and card members table of contents an increasing prevalence of surcharging by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases the number of countries in the eu that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of american express cards only could increase following adoption of new eu wide regulation as discussed in global network merchant services regulation in australia we have seen increasing merchant surcharging on american express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases on a basis that is greater than that applied to cards issued on the bankcard networks which is known as differential surcharging if surcharging becomes widespread american express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cards in force and transaction volumes the impact could vary depending on the manner in which a surcharge is levied and whether surcharges are levied upon all payment cards whether debit cards are excluded or whether the amount of the surcharge varies depending on the card network acquirer or issuer surcharging could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent surcharging disproportionately impacts our card members through differential surcharging or otherwise if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in business process and technology advances across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analysis customer interactions and communications alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services our success will depend in part on our ability to innovate by offering new payment services products develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours if we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation manage the shift to mobile device based and multi channel commerce drive adoption of new products and services or improve the quality of the card member experience our business and results of operations could be adversely affected our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for industry wide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card members or merchants or the complexity of our systems we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through our marketing promotion merchant acceptance and rewards programs or to effectively control the costs of such programs both of which may impact our profitability increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing card lending balances depend in part on our ability to develop and issue new or enhanced cards and increase revenues from such products if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value they may fail to accept our new products and services which would negatively impact our results of operations increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer one of the ways in which we attract new card members reduce card member attrition and seek to retain or capture a greater share of customers total spending is through our membership rewards program as well as other card member benefits any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of membership rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability in addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs that are similar to ours and issuers may in the future institute programs and services that are more attractive than ours we have been spending at elevated levels on a number of growth initiatives over the past couple years and expect to continue spending at similar levels in 2016 there can be no assurance that any of our investments to acquire card members and increase usage of our cards will be effective we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and card member services expenses in the future if such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as fee based revenues or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment table of contents our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and its attributes are key assets of ours and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices merchant acceptance financial condition and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card members and corporate clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new card members and customers and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of a third party vendor merchant acquirer or gns partner may be attributed by card members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payments systems adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability if we cannot successfully execute on our strategy our business and financial results may be adversely impacted we may not be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results these strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long term shareholder value and include u0095 growing our card member base and merchant network u0095 deepening customer relationships through lending and rewards u0095 increasing our international presence u0095 growing in commercial payments u0095 developing newer adjacent opportunities like our loyalty coalition business the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our ability to compete effectively in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues if at all our growth strategy also includes the pursuit of new business opportunities and potentially acquisitions however we may not be able to take advantage of new business opportunities or to identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us which could impair our growth we also continue to pursue a disciplined expense management strategy although there is no guarantee that we will be able to control the growth of expenses expenses incurred in our foreign entities are subject to foreign exchange volatility and may cause our expenses to increase in any particular period even if we otherwise achieve cost savings in addition compliance legal and related costs are difficult to predict or control given the current environment and may vary from period to period as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve we have invested and will continue to invest significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our protective security measures investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and develop new technology to mitigate security risks if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses our financial results will be negatively affected a significant disruption or breach in the security of our information technology systems or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards we and other third parties process transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees table of contents global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code social engineering attacks including phishing denial of service attacks and security breaches for example we and other u s financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denial of service attacks from sophisticated third parties our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including card member and loyalty program account information employee information and other sensitive business information there are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites as outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments industry increase there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards and there is a risk the confidentiality privacy and or security of data held by third parties including merchants that accept our cards and our business partners may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to the compromise we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing data breaches and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts the possibility of data breaches malicious social engineering and fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information online accounts and systems these risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed for example with the increased use of emv technology we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages telecommunications failures fraud denial of service and other cyber attacks terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or similar events service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed countries could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those countries if our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our cards or customer online accounts were to rise due to a data breach at a business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response costs greater concerns of customers and or business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and have a material adverse impact on our business if such disruptions or breaches are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded data breaches and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or data protection including leaked business data may also disrupt our operations undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies successful cyber attacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions large retailers or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event we face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries for example we have partnered with delta air lines as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including the airline industry to offer benefits to card member participants competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically have high spending loyal customers our entire cobrand portfolio table of contents accounted for approximately 22 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2015 card member loans held for investment related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 33 percent of our worldwide card member loans held for investment as of december 31 2015 which do not include card member loans related to our cobrand partnerships with costco wholesale corporation in the united states and jetblue airways corporation that were transferred to held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets effective december 1 2015 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans and receivables held for sale we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more partnership relationships in addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the receivables generated with respect to its program which could result in a significant decline in our card member loans outstanding for example we previously announced that our u s cobrand relationship with costco is set to end in 2016 and we expect to sell the outstanding card member loans associated with the costco portfolio for a discussion on costco and our expectations regarding the portfolio sale see business environment under md a in november 2015 starwood hotels resorts worldwide with which we have a cobrand relationship announced that it agreed to be acquired by marriott international which has a cobrand relationship with a competing card issuer we also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships increases in 2015 both card member rewards expense and cost of card member services increased when compared to the prior year reflecting a portion of the increased costs related to several recently renewed cobrand partnerships the loss of business partners whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with costco in the united states in 2016 or early termination as the result of a merger or otherwise such as the withdrawal of american airlines in 2014 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members or the renegotiation of existing relationships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card members and merchants and could lessen our negotiating power with our remaining and prospective business partners we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries including the airline industry that represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with these industries including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations and alliances of our partners and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners and merchants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as i our filing for bankruptcy ii our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured debt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade by s p and moody s iii our ceasing to have a public debt rating or iv a shortfall in certain performance levels if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations similarly we have credit risk to certain cobrand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that may not be fully redeemed we are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations for example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards the airline industry which represents a significant portion of our billed business has undergone bankruptcies restructurings consolidations and other similar events in the past the airline industry accounted for approximately eight percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2015 our largest airline cobrand portfolio american express delta skymiles accounted for approximately six percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december 31 2015 and approximately 20 percent of worldwide card member loans held for investment as of december 31 2015 we have credit risk to the airline industry to the extent we protect card members against non delivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a card member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we will bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline industry under md a table of contents we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand as discussed in global commercial services we created a joint venture for our global business travel operations in 2014 there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the underlying assumptions related to the joint venture transaction including accelerating the transformation and growth of the corporate travel business creating additional investment capacity and enhancing its suite of products and services we and the gbt jv face the risk of potential loss of key customers vendors and other key business partners as a result of the joint venture transaction our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with the joint venture transaction could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction incur unanticipated liabilities and adversely affect our operations we rely on third party providers of various computer systems platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could harm our business we rely on third party service providers merchants processors aggregators gns partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations including the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network if a service provider or other third party fails to provide the data quality communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or other cybersecurity incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers we are subject to the risk that activities of our third party service providers may adversely affect our business a failure to exercise adequate oversight over third party service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us there is also a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third party networks or platforms could become compromised which could significantly harm our business even if the attack or breach does not impact our systems in addition the management of multiple third party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control it is also possible that the cost efficiencies of certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for these services increases around the world our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics intrusion into or degradation of our infrastructure by hackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business because of our proximity to the world trade center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our information technology systems because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel related spending our business will be sensitive to safety concerns and thus is likely to decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues or when travel might involve health related risks in addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel caused by such events can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies that we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travel related spending if the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations card member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events the impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel as further described in supervision and regulation compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of our u s bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the fdic and the occ regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business table of contents legal regulatory and compliance risks ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand the doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the u s antitrust laws visa and mastercard which were also defendants in the doj and state action entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement which was approved by the court the settlement enjoins visa and mastercard from entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale on february 19 2015 the trial court found that the challenged provisions in american express card acceptance agreements were anticompetitive and on april 30 2015 issued a final judgment prohibiting us from enforcing certain elements of such provisions we appealed this judgment and on december 18 2015 the court of appeals for the second circuit stayed the trial court s judgment pending the issuance of its appellate decision we are also a defendant in a number of actions and arbitration proceedings including proposed class actions filed by merchants that challenge the non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages a description of these legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings an adverse outcome in these proceedings against us including an adverse final judgment following appeal in the doj and state action could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation and or arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in visa s and mastercard s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability our business is subject to significant and extensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world the current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased and unpredictable regulatory investigations and enforcement is likely to continue to result in changes to our business practices products and procedures increased costs including increased compliance costs and potentially additional penalties and or restitution payments to card members in addition new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and card members or affect retention of our key personnel such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements to maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain activities or acquisitions additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital in recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards fee regulation can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for example gns or cobrand arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to non discrimination and honor all cards we have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the eu court of justice to invalidate the application of price caps in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner there can be no assurance that our legal challenge will be successful for a description of certain regulations and their impact on us see global network merchant services regulation legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml programs increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action and our reputation may table of contents suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions in addition member states of the european economic area have implemented the psd for electronic payment services that put in place a common legal framework for licensing and supervision of payment services providers including card issuers and merchant acquirers and for their conduct of business complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about the material laws and regulations to which we are subject litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation and or a material adverse effect on our business businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future on october 7 2015 the cfpb announced a proposal that would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed this proposal is the beginning of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule if any becoming effective before 2018 the continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters we have been subject to regulatory actions by the cfpb and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the recent trend towards larger settlement amounts could lead to more adverse outcomes in any enforcement actions against us in the future we expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non public supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements including those imposed by the new capital rules the lcr or by regulators in implementing other portions of the basel iii framework could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase our common stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital and liquidity regime that will apply to us and our u s bank subsidiaries as a result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity the capital requirements applicable to the company as a bank holding company and our u s bank subsidiaries have been substantially revised to implement the international basel iii framework and are in the process of being phased in once these revisions are fully phased in the company and our u s bank subsidiaries will be required to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past as part of our required stress testing both internally and by the federal reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the new capital rules as they are phased in compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules including the new capital rules and the lcr will require a material investment of resources an inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the company and our u s bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approaches implementation depending on how the advanced approaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types our capital ratios table of contents calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach in such a case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio there are several recent proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as the company and our u s bank subsidiaries as well as our ability to meet these requirements the basel committee has adopted a framework that would impose a capital buffer on certain banks that may have an important impact on their domestic economies so called domestic systemically important banks or d sibs additionally the basel committee has proposed a series of revisions to the standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirements if these or other proposals are adopted in the united states and applied to advanced approaches institutions we could be required to hold significantly more capital for more information on capital adequacy requirements see capital adequacy and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the federal reserve for review as part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment if our capital plan is not approved for any reason or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted a failure to increase dividends along with our competitors or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of american express our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our series b and series c preferred stock american express company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state law limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company in particular our u s bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on their declaration and payment of dividends these limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding american express

data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and or use personal information as privacy data protection and information security laws are interpreted and applied compliance costs may increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place in recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information security in the united states and in various countries in which we operate in addition legislators and or regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information security related practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer and or employee information and some of our current or planned business activities new legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives moreover the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws relating to customer and or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed loop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and or governmental investigations and or actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand table of contents we may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment i e natural disasters operational risk includes among others the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third party s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to data in our systems we grant to third party service providers as processes are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational and compliance risks can expose us to reputational risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations if we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage in addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation a future assertion of an infringement claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant monetary damages tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations these tax authorities may challenge our positions or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which may potentially result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities in addition unilateral or multi jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity to address base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities credit liquidity and market risks our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return we have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk asset liability risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk model risk and reputational risk see risk management under md a for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and or forecasting models although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused if our decisions are based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we may face adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation in addition some decisions our regulators make including those related to our capital distribution plans may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient table of contents we may not be able to effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt business loans settlement with gns partners merchant and consumer bankruptcies delinquencies and other credit trends that can affect spending on card products debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our card products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member receivables and loans and institutional credit risk from merchants gns partners gcs clients plenti partners and treasury and investment counterparties third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons country regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses after write off and delinquency rates reached historical lows they have recently leveled out and begun to increase in line with our expectations higher write off rates and an increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds in addition our ability to recover amounts that we have previously written off may be limited which could have a negative impact on our revenues although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud we may also fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of our customers in addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provision for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital we need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities if we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk we may maintain too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility or we may be too illiquid which could limit our investments in growth opportunities curtail operations or result in financial distress during a liquidity event the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from card members and merchants cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash direct and third party sourced deposits debt instruments such as unsecured medium and long term notes and asset securitizations securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities the federal reserve discount window and long term committed bank borrowing facilities our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to capital required to operate our business such market conditions may limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to grow our business as such we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility market disruption and volatility could have an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access capital and on our business financial condition and results of operations for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see consolidated capital resources and liquidity funding programs and activities under md a any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries long term and short term debt are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding table of contents adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital during 2015 approximately 24 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the united states we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the u s dollar which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 foreign currency movements relative to the u s dollar negatively impacted our net revenues of 32 8 billion by approximately 1 3 billion as the u s dollar strengthened against many currencies over the course of the year we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into u s dollars political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local card members spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by card members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency substantial and sudden devaluation of local card members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country the occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our result of operations interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time and we expect interest rates to rise in the future if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net income could fall our interest expense was approximately 1 6 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 a hypothetical 1 0 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 216 million as of december 31 2015 in addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balance amounts card members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations for a further discussion of our interest rate risk see risk management market risk management process under md a the value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition we held approximately 3 8 billion of investment securities as of december 31 2015 in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business as a source of funding our u s bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through third party brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through american express personal savings as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 54 1 billion in total u s retail deposits we face strong competition in the deposit markets particularly as to brokerage networks aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect our retention of existing balances and the cost efficient acquisition of new deposit funds if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted customers could also close their accounts or reduce balances in favor of products and services offered by competitors for reasons other than price including general dissatisfaction with our products or services and concerns over online security or our reputation our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our u s bank subsidiaries the fdia in certain circumstances prohibits banks including centurion bank and american express bank from accepting brokered deposits and applies other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates we may pay see prompt corrective action under regulation and supervision for additional information a significant amount of our outstanding u s retail deposits has been raised through third party brokerage networks and such deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes while centurion bank and american express bank were considered well capitalized as of december 31 2015 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition the new capital rules when fully phased in will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common table of contents equity additionally our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses including the interest rate we pay on deposits an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business ","item 3 legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we and our subsidiaries are subject to various claims investigations examinations pending and potential legal actions and other matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings we believe we have meritorious defenses to each of these legal proceedings and intend to defend them vigorously some of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages we believe we are not a party to nor are any of our properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings including the possible resolution of merchant claims described later in this section could have a material impact on our results of operations in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of the doj case described later in this section could have a material adverse effect on our business certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below for those legal proceedings described in this section where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a related reserve for legal contingencies or where there is no such reserve and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to 350 million in excess of any reserves related to those matters this range represents our estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such proceedings evolve including the merchant claims we may need to increase our range of possible loss or reserves for legal contingencies for additional information see note 13 to our

company act of 1956 and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital leverage and liquidity requirements current business environment outlook our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook reflecting the headwinds that we have been managing throughout 2015 including a challenging economic competitive and regulatory environment results for the quarter were significantly affected by higher spending on growth initiatives as well as the continued impact of certain previously renewed co brand partnerships and the stronger u s dollar while our reported third quarter earnings reflected the impact of these discrete items our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth write off rates at historically low levels disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position as well as strong card member and merchant acquisitions on a reported basis the card member billed business growth rate in the third quarter was modestly slower relative to the second quarter of 2015 and billings were flat when compared with the third quarter of 2014 billings growth particularly in the u s continued to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015 we saw lower average transaction sizes although there has been an increase in the number of transactions in addition we saw a slowdown in growth in spending by middle market corporate customers in the u s we also saw spending by costco u s co brand card members soften compared to the prior year while we will continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters overall international volumes were up compared to the third quarter of 2014 excluding canada due to the termination of our relationship with costco canada last year and after adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates table of contents we have continued to see strong growth in worldwide card member loans which along with a reduction in borrowing costs during the quarter contributed to an increase in net interest income u s loan growth was steady and loan growth internationally excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in canadian loan balances which were negatively impacted by the end of our costco relationship in canada improved during the quarter our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances drove an increase in provision versus last year while credit metrics had been steadily improving since the latter half of 2009 following the economic downturn they have generally stabilized at their current levels over the course of the past year therefore reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed for higher loan balances this performance is in line with our expectation that provision would increase year over year and in part reflects the steady growth that we are seeing in the loan portfolio going forward we do anticipate that write off rates will gradually increase from today s low levels in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages we have increased our spending on growth initiatives which appears in our marketing and promotion expenses as well as in operating expenses and contra discount revenue operating expenses for the third quarter of 2015 decreased on a reported basis but are higher after adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates we continue to remain committed to containing operating expense growth in 2015 for the third quarter of 2015 operating expenses include a 91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs primarily in our enterprise growth eg business including our decision not to continue with certain investments in the business we continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities in this context we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in our eg business during the current quarter including the decision not to proceed with the launch of our serve product in mexico these decisions are consistent with recent organizational changes designed to better align eg s capabilities with the overall strategy and priorities of the company while focusing on those opportunities that can produce the best returns and ensure that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way we plan to continue to evaluate the strategic direction of the eg business in the fourth quarter which could result in additional impairment while our business is diversified by product and geography including a range of consumer and commercial card offerings a large international business and gns partners around the world which we believe provide a range of growth opportunities we will continue to face a number of challenges throughout the remainder of 2015 and 2016 global economic growth remains uneven in addition our results continued to be adversely impacted by the strengthening u s dollar and we expect foreign exchange will continue to have an adverse impact for the remainder of 2015 and could impact 2016 as well our results could also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and u s income tax law changes regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and various governments around the world have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes see certain legislative regulatory and other developments for additional information on the legislative and regulatory environment including the potential impacts of regulatory changes in the card payment sector in the european union eu competition is extremely intense across the payments industry including within the co brand space which has generally led to increased costs in our renewed co brand partnerships during the third quarter of 2015 both card member rewards expense and cost of card member services continued to grow when compared to the prior year reflecting a portion of the increased costs related to recently renewed co brand partnerships table of contents as previously announced our co brand and merchant acceptance agreements with costco in the u s will not be renewed and are contractually set to expire on march 31 2016 although the softening in spending by existing costco u s co brand card members mentioned above has adversely impacted our billed business volumes we have not yet seen a significant earnings impact as lower volume growth has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co brand portfolio earlier this year in early 2015 as we considered the implications of the end of our relationship with costco in the u s we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position us for long term growth for the balance of the year we expect results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discrete impacts from changes in our co brand relationships and a stronger u s dollar year over year earnings per share growth will also be negatively impacted by a net benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the sale of our investment in concur we estimate that full year 2015 earnings per share will be between 5 20 and 5 35 we believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12 to 15 percent earnings per share growth in 2017 remains appropriate our outlook for 2015 through 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies as previously disclosed a trial court ruled in favor of the u s department of justice doj in its antitrust lawsuit against us following the decision on april 30 2015 the trial court issued an injunction requiring us to change the provisions in our agreements with merchants accepting american express cards in the u s that historically prohibited merchants from engaging in various actions to encourage card members to use other credit or charge card products or networks the injunction became effective on july 20 2015 we are vigorously pursuing an appeal of the decision and judgment and we are vigorously defending similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see certain legislative regulatory and other developments in

3 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively 1 the increases on an fx adjusted basis were due to growth in billed business of 5 percent and 6 percent also fx adjusted for the three and nine month periods respectively partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate faster growth in gns billings than in overall company billings increases in cash rebate rewards recognized as contra discount revenue and generally higher contra revenues related to payments under previously renewed co brand partnership agreements 1 billed business in the u s increased 4

business outside the u s increasing 8 percent for both the three and nine month periods 1 the average discount rate was 2 46 percent and 2 48 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively and 2 48 percent and 2 49 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2014 respectively the decrease in the average discount rate for both the three and nine month periods was driven in part by growth of the optblue program changes in industry mix and competition partially offset by the decline in costco merchant volume in canada which was at a lower discount rate than the average due to the expiration of our merchant agreement as well as changes in fx rates as indicated in prior quarters changes in the mix of spending by location and industry volume related pricing discounts strategic investments certain pricing initiatives competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate net card fees decreased 1 million and 28 million for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted net card fees increased 6 percent and 5 percent for the respective periods primarily driven by higher basic cards in force as well as a benefit from certain pricing initiatives 1 travel commissions and fees decreased 17 million or 16 percent and 756 million or 74 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction in the prior year resulting in a lack of comparability between periods other commissions and fees remained relatively flat for both the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted other commissions and fees increased 9 percent and 10 percent for the respective periods 1 the increases on an fx adjusted basis were driven in part by higher loyalty coalition revenues as well as higher delinquency fees other revenue decreased 89 million or 15 percent and 186 million or 11 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted other revenue decreased 7 percent and 4 percent for the respective periods 1 the decrease on an fx adjusted basis for the three month period was primarily driven by gains related to the sale of investment securities in the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc and in concur technologies in the prior year which for the nine month period was partially offset by higher revenues earned related to the gbt jv transition services agreement in the current year 1the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a

respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase for the three month period was primarily driven by higher write off rates in uscs versus the prior year and the decrease in

and 32 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year the increases were driven by credit performance

decreased 112 million or 5 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase for the three month period was primarily driven by increased spending on incremental growth initiatives while the decrease for the nine month period was primarily driven by the prior year reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives table of contents card member rewards expense increased 68 million or 4 percent and 152 million or 3 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year and fx adjusted card member rewards expense increased 7 percent and 6 percent for the respective periods 2 the increase for the three months ended september 30 2015 was primarily due to an increase in co brand rewards expense of 60 million driven by rate impacts as a result of the previously renewed co brand partnership agreements and an increase in membership rewards expense of 8 million the latter was driven by an increase of 31 million related to new points earned resulting from higher spending volumes partially offset by a 23 million decrease from slower growth in the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr and a decline in the weighted average cost wac per point the increase for the nine months ended september 30 2015 was primarily due to an increase in co brand rewards expense of 180 million also driven by rate impacts partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of 28 million the latter was driven by slower growth in the urr and a charge in 2014 related to an enhancement in the membership rewards urr estimation process for certain international countries partially offset by increased expenses related to new points earned driven by higher spending volumes card member services and other expense increased 64 million or 31 percent and 153 million or 25 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted card member services and other expense increased 38 percent and 32 percent for the respective periods primarily driven by higher costs related to the previously renewed co brand partnership agreements 2 salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 78 million or 6 percent and 721 million or 16 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year the decrease for the nine month period was primarily driven by the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods and the restructuring charge in the prior year the restructuring initiatives in the prior year resulted in lower compensation costs and contributed to the current year decrease for both the three and nine month periods other expenses increased 39 million or 2 percent and 176 million or 4 percent for the three and nine months ended september 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year and fx adjusted other expenses increased 6 percent and 8 percent for the respective periods 2 the increase in the three month period primarily reflected a 91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs primarily within our eg business including our decision not to continue with certain initiatives within eg other expenses were also favorably impacted by a litigation reserve release of 64 million in the gnms segment associated with the rejected 2013 merchant litigation settlement see part ii item 1 legal proceedings for further information on this merchant litigation the increase in the nine month period reflected the net gain recognized as a result of the business travel joint venture transaction in the prior year resulting in a lack of comparability between periods as well as the previously mentioned impairment charge in the current year which were partially offset by a favorable impact from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain uk legal entities in the current year the litigation reserve release mentioned previously a contribution to the american express foundation and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our community reinvestment act cra portfolio the latter two in the prior year 2 refer to footnote 1 on page 39 for details regarding foreign currency adjusted information table

table 5 selected statistical information a in the three months ended march 31 2015 we changed the classification related to certain payments to partners reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense the misclassification in prior periods has been revised to conform to the current period presentation accordingly the average discount rate for prior periods was also revised resulting in a reduction of between zero and one basis point in any period from what was originally reported b average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only average fee per card is computed based on net card fees including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards in force the average fee per card adjusted which is a non gaap measure is computed in the same manner but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs the amount of amortization excluded was 72 million and 77 million for the three months ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively and 217 million and 227 million for the nine months ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we present

consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain u0095 a solid and flexible equity capital profile u0095 a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and u0095 liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions inclusive of transition provisions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets see section on transitional basel iii the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1 2019 see section on fully phased in basel iii we also report capital

million we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income historically capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements to the extent capital has exceeded business regulatory and rating agency requirements we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u s subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u s parent company fully phased in basel iii basel iii when

nine months ended september 30 2015 we returned 1 7 billion and 4 1 billion respectively to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends 0 3 billion and 0 8 billion respectively and share repurchases 1 4 billion and 3 3 billion respectively we repurchased 17 8 million common shares at an average price of 76 47 in the third quarter of 2015 these dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 126 percent and 95 percent of total capital generated during the three and nine month periods respectively which was above our on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock these distribution percentages result from the strength of our capital ratios and the amount of capital we generate from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support our organic business growth and acquisitions in addition during

maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries table of contents our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes including acquisition activities management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time during the three months ended september 30 2015 we issued i 1 0 billion of asset backed securities from american express credit account master trust the lending trust with a maturity of two years consisting of 1 0

2015 asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member receivables and loans arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as card member receivables and loans on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of investor securities during the nine months ended september 30 2015 no such triggering events occurred liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet business requirements and expected future financial obligations for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we have in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out our approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise wide basis table of contents we incur and accept liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering our products and services the liquidity risks that we are exposed to can arise from a variety of sources and thus our liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters assessments and guidelines including but not limited to maintaining a diversified set of funding sources refer to funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources available to meet obligations projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios including contingent liquidity exposures such as collateral requirements for derivative transactions and incorporating tradeoffs between the risk of insufficient liquidity and our profitability into capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets on balance sheet as well as off balance sheet financing such as committed bank credit facilities and abs conduit facilities in order to comply with requirements of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the lcr we through our u s bank subsidiaries also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window we seek to satisfy the requirements of a variety of stress scenarios including those required by law and regulation as well as our own stress scenario in order to determine the amount and mix of the liquidity sources we maintain at any given time these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics and vary by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors our own stress scenarios include market wide and firm specific liquidity events the lcr is another stress scenario that prescribes distinct cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes criteria for qualifying high quality liquid assets during the nine months ended september 30 2015 the company was in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which it is subject including the lcr in addition to satisfying internal and regulatory liquidity buffer requirements we consider various factors in determining the amount of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations the yield we receive on our cash and readily marketable securities is generally less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances thus we incur substantial net interest costs on these amounts the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of our cash and readily marketable securities holdings as well as the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of september 30 2015 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2018 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 15 2017 that gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of september 30 2015 a de minimis amount was drawn on the charge trust facility which was subsequently repaid on october 15 2015 no amounts were drawn on the lending trust facility table of contents federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 58 1 billion as of september 30 2015 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our existing securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of september 30 2015 of 3 0 billion which expires on april 23 2017 on september 25 2015 we repaid all outstanding loans on our australian dollar credit facility and terminated the facility in accordance with our right to terminate prior to

increase in cash and cash equivalents 2 4 1 8 cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for the nine months ended september 30 2015 and 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 8 1 billion and 8 6 billion respectively driven by in both periods net income of 4 3 billion and 4 4 billion respectively adjusted for non cash items including certain changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the decrease in the current period as compared to the nine months ended september 30 2014 primarily resulted from movements in other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as a result of normal business operating activities and primarily driven by changes in merchant payable volumes cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans and our available for sale investment securities portfolio table of contents for the nine months ended september 30 2015 and 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 2 7 billion and 3 0 billion respectively the decrease in the current period as compared to the nine months ended september 30 2014 was primarily driven by a comparative decrease in card member receivables and loans offset by higher restricted cash related to upcoming maturities of long term debt in the american express credit account master trust cash flows from financing activities our financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the nine months ended september 30 2015 and 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 7 5 billion and 3 7 billion respectively the variance was primarily driven by a higher net increase in customer deposits offset by higher net debt repayments in the current year versus the same period in the prior year certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of september 30 2015 we had approximately 289 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations in light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms including us and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and rules that would or do impose changes on certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged for card acceptance as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and or to localize aspects of their operations the development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network table of contents european union payments legislation in july 2013 the european commission proposed legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry the first part was a proposed eu wide regulation on interchange fees the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revisions to the payment services directive the psd2 the interchange fee regulation was formally adopted in april 2015 the substantive terms as adopted include the following price caps interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the eu will be capped generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances although we do not have interchange fees as four party networks such as visa and mastercard have and three party networks such as american express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks when they license third party providers to issue cards and or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a co brand partner or through an agent this means for example the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our gns partners in the eu the caps will take effect in december 2015 however individual eu member states have the option to postpone for a further three years the effectiveness of these caps in relation to transactions with no cross border component on three party networks with very limited market share in that member state the discount rates we agree to with merchants will not be capped but the interchange caps will likely exert additional downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates and may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps card acceptance terms anti steering and honor all cards rules across all card networks including non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all cards rules takes effect in june 2016 network licensing from december 2016 the geographic scope of network licenses within the eu including those we agree to with our gns partners will cover the entire eu this may undermine the value of licenses granted to some gns partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity in relation to a particular country separation of network processing from june 2016 card networks will be required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this requirement does not apply to three party payment networks such as american express but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network co badging of cards from june 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provisions may harm the american express brand insofar as gns issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards table of contents on october 8 2015 the european parliament formally adopted the psd2 following the european parliament s vote the psd2 will be formally adopted by the eu council of ministers the psd2 will then be published in the official journal of the eu at which point each member state will have two years to transpose the psd2 into national law among other terms the published text of psd2 includes provisions that would i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the ability of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer the potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirements would undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our gns business dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets among other matters the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws moreover the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services including american express company and certain of our subsidiaries the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and banking regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties in december 2013 we announced that certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators including the cfpb to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add on products for a description of these settlements see part i item 3 legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2013 in october 2012 we announced that american express company and certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators including the cfpb relating to certain aspects of our u s consumer card practices for a description of these settlements see part i item 3 legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2012 on october 7 2015 the cfpb announced a proposal that would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed this proposal is the beginning of a rulemaking process that may not result in a final rule if any becoming effective before 2018 table of contents dodd frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment such as cash check credit or debit card or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum and for certain merchants maximum transaction amounts for credit cards as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements under dodd frank the federal reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks the federal reserve s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for prepaid cards and we are therefore not a payment card network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule dodd frank also authorizes the federal reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements including capital leverage and liquidity standards risk management requirements concentration limits on credit exposures mandatory resolution plans so called living wills and stress tests for among others large bank holding companies such as american express company that have greater than 50 billion in assets we are also required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the capital plan to the federal reserve for our quantitative and qualitative review under the federal reserve s ccar process in addition certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared which have increased our collateral posting requirements in september 2014 the u s commodity futures trading commission and the u s federal banking agencies issued proposals that would impose mandatory margining requirements for certain non cleared swaps which may further increase collateral posting requirements for us antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court has ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction effective july 20 2015 prohibiting us from enforcing certain elements of such provisions in the united states we are vigorously pursuing an appeal of the decision and judgment and we are vigorously defending similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings below for descriptions of the doj action and related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business see part ii item 1a risk factors in our quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30 2015 for information on the potential impacts of the trial court s decision the subsequent injunction and the related merchant litigation on our business table of contents other legislative and regulatory initiatives in certain countries such as australia and in certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread the reserve bank of australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance in the eu the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those member states that permit surcharging in december 2014 the australian financial system inquiry published a report to the australian federal government that included a number of recommendations for changing the way payment cards are regulated in australia if implemented by the government or the reserve bank of australia these recommendations would have a significant impact across the industry including american express the financial system inquiry s recommendations included the following publishing thresholds for determining which payment networks are designated for regulation broadening interchange fee caps to include all amounts payable to card issuers in regulated payment systems as well as other payments to card issuers across both three and four party card payment networks lowering interchange fee caps replacing periodic weighted average caps with fixed percentage caps and applying caps as the lesser of a fixed amount or a fixed percentage changing the rules on merchant surcharging to allow low cost payment networks to prohibit surcharging medium cost networks to cap surcharges and high cost networks to limit surcharging as is currently the case to the reasonable cost of card acceptance on march 4 2015 the reserve bank of australia commenced a formal review of the regulatory framework for card payments in australia considering the above recommendations from the financial systems inquiry along with a broader range of measures related to card payments regulation the australian federal government and reserve bank of australia will now determine whether and how any of these recommendations or alternative options should be implemented we do not expect changes if any to take effect before mid 2016 on october 15 2015 the reserve bank of australia announced that it designated our gns business designation is a formal step prior to regulation which could subject our gns business in australia to the same interchange caps that apply to visa and mastercard in australia any such regulation could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in australia on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union ruled that the european commission s safe harbor framework is invalid as a basis for transfers of personal data from the european economic area countries to the u s we

company act of 1956 and the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator as such we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations policies and minimum capital standards current business environment outlook our results for the second quarter of 2015 reflected higher spending by our card members growth in average card member loans which drove higher net interest income and disciplined expense control credit quality indicators were again at or near historically low levels and our strong balance sheet allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends during the quarter consistent with recent quarters our results this quarter were adversely affected by the significant impact of a stronger u s dollar on international operations the year ago quarter also included business travel operations and a net gain related to the gbt jv transaction impacting year over year comparisons in the second quarter of 2015 we saw an increase in card member billed business although billings growth was slightly slower compared with the first quarter the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and a slowdown in spending by costco u s co brand card members and corporate customers in the u s were drivers of this deceleration we did experience improved billings growth across our international markets after adjusting for foreign currency exchange rates and excluding billed business in canada which has been negatively impacted by the termination of our relationship with costco in that country the growth of worldwide card member loans and a reduction in borrowing costs during the second quarter of 2015 contributed to an increase in net interest income credit performance continued to be strong in the quarter we would expect that with future loan growth or any adverse changes in credit performance provision would increase year over year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015 operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 decreased on a reported basis as well as on an adjusted basis after excluding the gbt jv transaction gain and related transaction and other costs and business travel operating expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2014 we remain committed to containing operating expense growth in 2015 table of contents while our business is diversified by product and geography including a range of consumer and commercial card offerings a large international business and gns partners around the world which we believe provide a range of growth opportunities as noted above we continue to face a number of challenges throughout the remainder of 2015 and 2016 global economic growth remains uneven in addition our results continued to be significantly impacted by the strengthening u s dollar and we expect foreign exchange will have an adverse impact for the remainder of 2015 our results could also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and u s income tax law changes regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and various governments around the world have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes see certain legislative regulatory and other developments for additional information on the legislative and regulatory environment including the potential impacts of regulatory changes in the card payment sector in the european union eu competition also remains extremely intense across the payments industry within the co brand space more intense competition has generally led to increased costs in our renewed co brand partnerships during the second quarter of 2015 card member rewards expense and cost of card member services both continued to grow reflecting a portion of the increased costs related to recently renewed co brand partnerships for the remainder of 2015 we expect to see a continued impact of these renegotiated relationships as previously announced our co brand and merchant acceptance agreements with costco in the u s will not be renewed and are set to expire on march 31 2016 we have continued to see slowing of new costco u s co brand card member acquisitions which along with customer behavior changes will adversely impact our billed business in 2015 to proactively prepare for the end of the costco u s partnership in 2016 we have made and intend to continue to make investments in growth initiatives across our company that we believe offer attractive returns over time and position us for continued long term growth as a result we expect annual marketing and promotion expenses in 2015 to be relatively similar to the elevated level of 2014 our earnings per share outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings per share growth to be flat to modestly down as a result of the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives weighted more heavily to the second half of the year along with the prior year benefits from the sale of our investment in concur and other factors it is also likely that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically through the remainder of 2015 and beyond while we go through this transitional period in 2016 we expect to return to positive earnings per share growth and in 2017 we expect to return to 12 to 15 percent earnings per share growth within our target range this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies as previously disclosed a trial court ruled in favor of the u s department of justice doj in its antitrust lawsuit against us following the decision on april 30 2015 the trial court issued an injunction requiring us to change the provisions in our agreements with merchants accepting american express cards in the u s that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to encourage card members to use other credit or charge card products or networks the injunction became effective on july 20 2015 we are vigorously pursuing an appeal of the decision and judgment see certain legislative

for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year foreign currency adjusted discount revenue which excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange fx rates increased 4 percent for both the three and six months ended june 30 2015 1 the increases were due to growth in billed business of 2 percent for both the three and six month periods 6 percent on an fx adjusted basis for both periods partially offset by faster growth in gns billings than in overall company billings increases in cash incentives and higher contra revenues related to renewed co brand partnership payments the increase for the three months ended june 30 2015 was also driven by an increase in the average discount rate versus the same period in the prior year billed business increased 5 percent in the u s for both the three and six month periods and decreased 5 percent and 4 percent outside the u s in the same periods fx adjusted billed business outside the u s increased 9 percent and 8 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively 1 the average discount rate was 2 49 percent for both the three and six months ended june 30 2015 and 2 48 percent and 2 49 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2014 respectively the increase in the average discount rate for the three month period was driven by a benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals the average discount rate for both the three and six month periods was driven by the timing of certain contract signings and payments to merchant partners in the prior year the decline in costco canada merchant volumes which were at a lower discount rate than the average due to the expiration of our merchant acceptance agreement and changes in foreign exchange rates partially offset by the growth of the optblue program and changes in industry mix changes in the mix of spending by location and industry volume related pricing discounts strategic investments certain pricing initiatives competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors will likely result in continued erosion of our discount rate over time see tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance and the average discount rate net card fees decreased 20 million or 3 percent and 27 million or 2 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted net card fees increased 4 percent for both periods primarily driven by higher basic cards in force in uscs 1 travel commissions and fees decreased 405 million or 81 percent and 739 million or 80 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the business travel joint venture transaction resulting in a lack of comparability between periods other commissions and fees remained relatively flat for both the three and six months ended june 30 2015 as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted other commissions and fees increased 11 percent and 10 percent for the respective periods 1 the increase on an fx adjusted basis was primarily driven by higher delinquency fees and revenue from our loyalty partner business as well as an increase in merchant service revenue in the three months ended june 30 2015 1 the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u s dollars i e assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared certain amounts included in the calculations of foreign currency adjusted revenues and expenses which constitute non gaap measures are subject to management allocations we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates table of contents other revenue decreased 64 million or 11 percent and 97 million or 9 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year while fx adjusted other revenue decreased 4 percent and 2 percent for the respective periods 2 the decrease on an fx adjusted basis was primarily driven by gains related to the sale of investment securities in the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc in the prior year partially offset by revenues earned related to the gbt jv transition services agreement in the current year interest income increased 78 million or 4 percent and 159 million or 4 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the

and 84 million or 3 percent for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year the increase for the three months ended june 30 2015 was primarily due to an increase in co brand rewards expense of 49 million driven by rate impacts as a result of previously announced renewed co brand partnerships the increase in co brand rewards expense was partially offset by a decrease in membership rewards expense of 23 million the latter was driven by a decrease of 53 million as a result of slower growth in the membership rewards ultimate redemption rate urr and a charge in 2014 related to an enhancement in the membership rewards urr estimation process for certain international countries partially offset by a 30 million increase related to new points earned driven by higher spending volumes for the six months ended june 30 2015 co brand rewards expense increased 120 million also driven by rate impacts partially offset by a

six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to the same periods in the prior year both periods reflect the net gain recognized as a result of the business travel joint venture transaction in the prior year which was partially offset by a contribution to the american express foundation and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our community reinvestment act portfolio

changed the classification related to certain payments to partners reducing both discount revenue and marketing and promotion expense the misclassification in prior periods has been revised to conform to the current period presentation accordingly the average discount rate for prior periods was also revised resulting in a reduction of between zero and one basis point in any period from what was originally reported b average basic card member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only average fee per card is computed based on net card fees including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards in force the average fee per card adjusted which is a non gaap measure is computed in the same manner but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs the amount of amortization excluded was 62 million and 77 million for the three months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively and 145 million and 150 million for the six months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we present the average fee per card adjusted because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of

computation excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of 194 million and 192 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business corporate other corporate functions and certain other businesses including our enterprise growth group and other operations are included in corporate other corporate other net expense decreased to 189 million and 356 million for the three and six months ended june 30 2015 respectively as compared to 252 million and 482 million for the three and six months ended june 30 2014 respectively the decrease for the three months ended june 30 2015 was primarily driven by a contribution to the american express foundation incremental investments in growth initiatives and a restructuring charge all in the prior year the decrease in the six months ended june 30 2015 also reflected a favorable impact from the reassessment of the functional currency of certain uk legal entities results for both periods included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in consolidated capital resources and liquidity liquidity management as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness table of contents consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain u0095 a solid and flexible equity capital profile u0095 a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and u0095 liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements as a bank holding company we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u s federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain off balance sheet items beginning march 31 2015 we reported our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions inclusive of transition provisions and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets see section on transitional basel iii the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1 2019 see section on fully phased in basel iii we also report capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for advanced approaches institutions the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly disclosing regulatory risk based capital ratios using both the standardized and advanced approaches table of contents transitional basel iii the following table presents our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace as of june 30 2015 definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance are found in the consolidated capital resources and liquidity section of american

capital as of june 30 2015 was 187 million hence the total amount of subordinated debt included in tier 2 capital as of june 30 2015 was 787 million we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income historically capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements to the extent capital has exceeded business regulatory and rating agency requirements we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u s subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u s parent company table of contents fully phased in basel iii basel iii when fully phased in will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements with a greater emphasis on common equity the following table presents our estimates for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios had basel iii been fully phased in during the six months ended june 30 2015 these ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk weighted

which was above our on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock these distribution percentages result from the strength of our capital ratios and the amount of capital we generate from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to

asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries table of contents our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes including acquisition activities management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs in order to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from regulators relating to the requirements and as the interpretation of requirements evolves over time during the second quarter of 2015 we issued 2 15 billion of dual tranche senior unsecured notes from american express credit corporation with a

receivables and loans arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as card member receivables and loans on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses establishment of reserve funds or in a worst case scenario early amortization of investor securities during the six months ended june 30 2015 no such triggering events occurred liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources we maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet business requirements and expected future financial obligations for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we have in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out our approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise wide basis table of contents we incur and accept liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering our products and services the liquidity risks that we are exposed to can arise from a variety of sources and thus our liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters assessments and guidelines including but not limited to u0095 maintaining a diversified set of funding sources refer to funding strategy section for more details u0095 maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources available to meet obligations u0095 projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios including contingent liquidity exposures such as collateral requirements for derivative transactions and u0095 incorporating tradeoffs between the risk of insufficient liquidity and our profitability into capital adequacy framework we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets on balance sheet as well as off balance sheet financing such as committed bank credit facilities and abs conduit facilities in order to comply with requirements of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and other regulatory measures of liquidity such as the lcr we through our u s bank subsidiaries also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserve s discount window we seek to satisfy the requirements of a variety of stress scenarios including those required by law and regulation as well as our own stress scenario in order to determine the amount and mix of the liquidity sources we maintain at any given time these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics and vary by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors our own stress scenarios include market wide and firm specific liquidity events the lcr is another stress scenario that prescribes distinct cash flow assumptions over a 30 day period and establishes criteria for qualifying high quality liquid assets the company was in compliance with the liquidity requirements to which it is subject including the lcr for each month during the first and second quarters of 2015 in addition to satisfying internal and regulatory liquidity buffer requirements we consider various factors in determining the amount of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations the yield we receive on our cash and readily marketable securities is generally less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances thus we incur substantial net interest costs on these amounts the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of our cash and readily marketable securities holdings as well as the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of june 30 2015 we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july 15 2016 that gives us the right to sell up to 3 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust on july 15 2015 we extended the charge trust s 3 0 billion facility by two years to mature on july 15 2018 we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september 15 2017 that gives us the right to sell up to 2 0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of june 30 2015 no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility table of contents federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately 56 8 billion as of june 30 2015 in u s credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our existing securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section we maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of june 30 2015 of 6 5

operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments for the six months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 4 3 billion and 4 9 billion respectively driven by in both periods net income of 3 0 billion adjusted for non cash items including certain changes in provisions for losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stock based compensation the decrease in the current period as compared to the six months ended june 30 2014 resulted from a decline in accounts payable due to changes in merchant payable volumes table of contents cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily include changes in card member receivables and loans and our available for sale investment securities portfolio for the six months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 2 9 billion and 1 6 billion respectively the variance was primarily driven by higher restricted cash related to upcoming maturities of long term debt in the american express credit account master trust cash flows from financing activities our financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt changes in customer deposits issuing and repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends for the six months ended june 30 2015 and 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 2 5 billion and 4 4 billion respectively the variance was primarily driven by a higher net increase in customer deposits offset by higher net debt repayments in the current year certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of june 30 2015 we had approximately 283 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no pre set limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members table of contents other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry and as a bank holding company we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations in light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms including us and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and rules that would or do impose changes on certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems regulators and legislators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged for card acceptance as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance although unlike the visa and mastercard networks the american express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly for example the decision of the european commission the commission to make binding visa europe s commitments to cap its cross border credit card multilateral interchange fees to 30 basis points and change its rules on how cross border interchange is applied as well as the commission s charges against mastercard on cross border interchange fees could negatively impact the discount revenue we derive from our business in the eu as a result of downward marketplace pressure on merchant fees including our discount rates broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and or to localize aspects of their operations the development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network european union payments legislation in july 2013 the commission proposed legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry the first part was a proposed eu wide regulation on interchange fees the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of revisions to the payment services directive the psd2 the interchange fee regulation was formally adopted in april 2015 the substantive terms as adopted include the following u0095 price caps interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the eu will be capped generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances although we do not have interchange fees as four party networks such as visa and mastercard have and three party networks such as american express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks when they license third party providers to issue cards and or acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a co brand partner or through an agent this means for example the caps will apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our gns partners in the eu the caps will take effect in december 2015 however individual eu member states have the option to postpone for a further three years the effectiveness of these caps in relation to transactions with no cross border component on three party networks with very limited market share in that member state the discount rates we agree to with merchants will not be capped but the interchange caps will likely exert additional downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates and may undermine our ability to attract and retain gns partners the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps table of contents u0095 card acceptance terms anti steering and honor all cards rules across all card networks including non discrimination and honor all cards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the prohibition on anti steering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honor all cards rules takes effect in june 2016 u0095 network licensing from december 2016 the geographic scope of network licenses within the eu including those we agree to with our gns partners will cover the entire eu this may undermine the value of licenses granted to some gns partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity in relation to a particular country u0095 separation of network processing from june 2016 card networks will be required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement this requirement does not apply to three party payment networks such as american express but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network u0095 co badging of cards from june 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks merchants may install automatic mechanisms in point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder these provisions may harm the american express brand insofar as gns issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their point of sale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards on june 3 2015 the council of the european union published the final compromise text of the psd2 proposal following a trialogue process the proposal will now be put before the european parliament for plenary vote once formally adopted the psd2 would unlike the interchange fee regulation require transposition into national law by each member state likely over a period of two years among other terms the published compromise text of psd2 includes provisions that would i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the ability of an individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer the potential surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the access requirements would undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner in our gns business table of contents dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets among other matters the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws moreover the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services including american express company and certain of our subsidiaries the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and banking regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties in december 2013 we announced that certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators including the cfpb to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add on products for a description of these settlements see part i item 3 legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2013 in october 2012 we announced that american express company and certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators including the cfpb relating to certain aspects of our u s consumer card practices for a description of these settlements see part i item 3 legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2012 dodd frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment such as cash check credit or debit card or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum and for certain merchants maximum transaction amounts for credit cards as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements under dodd frank the federal reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks the federal reserve s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for prepaid cards and we are therefore not a payment card network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule table of contents dodd frank also authorizes the federal reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements including capital leverage and liquidity standards risk management requirements concentration limits on credit exposures mandatory resolution plans so called living wills and stress tests for among others large bank holding companies such as american express company that have greater than 50 billion in assets we are also required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the capital plan to the federal reserve for our quantitative and qualitative review under the federal reserve s ccar process in addition certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared which have increased our collateral posting requirements in september 2014 the u s commodity futures trading commission and the u s federal banking agencies issued proposals that would impose mandatory margining requirements for certain non cleared swaps which may further increase collateral posting requirements for us antitrust litigation the u s department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us in 2010 alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products violate the u s antitrust laws the trial court has ruled that the challenged provisions violate u s antitrust laws and issued an injunction effective july 20 2015 prohibiting us from enforcing certain elements of such provisions in the united states we are vigorously pursuing an appeal of the decision and judgment and we are vigorously defending similar antitrust claims initiated by merchants in other court and arbitration proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings below for descriptions of the doj action and related cases it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business see part ii item 1a risk factors below for information on the potential impacts of the adverse decision and injunction and of the related merchant litigation on our business other legislative and regulatory initiatives in certain countries such as australia and in certain member states in the eu merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members which is known as differential surcharging could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread the reserve bank of australia allows us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance in the eu the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those member states that permit surcharging in december 2014 the australian financial system inquiry published a report to the australian federal government that included a number of recommendations for changing the way payment cards are regulated in australia if implemented by the government or the reserve bank of australia these recommendations would have a significant impact across the industry including american express the financial system inquiry s recommendations included the following u0095 publishing thresholds for determining which payment networks are designated for regulation u0095 broadening interchange fee caps to include all amounts payable to card issuers in regulated payment systems as well as other payments to card issuers across both three and four party card payment networks u0095 lowering interchange fee caps replacing periodic weighted average caps with fixed percentage caps and applying caps as the lesser of a fixed amount or a fixed percentage table of contents u0095 changing the rules on merchant surcharging to allow low cost payment networks to prohibit surcharging medium cost networks to cap surcharges and high cost networks to limit surcharging as is currently the case to the reasonable cost of card acceptance the australian federal government and reserve bank of australia will now determine whether and how any of these recommendations or alternative options should be implemented we do not expect changes if any to take effect before late 2015 although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative the settlement by mastercard and visa in a u s merchant class litigation required among other things mastercard and visa to permit u s merchants subject to certain conditions to surcharge credit cards while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions in december 2013 we announced the proposed settlement of a number of u s merchant class action lawsuits which if approved would change certain
